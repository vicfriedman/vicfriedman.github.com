    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>Today I learned, among a million other things, that I will never escape SQL statements.</strong> I think I&#8217;ve finally faced it. During week 6 at <a href="http://flatironschool.com">The Flatiron School</a>, when the magic of Rails and ActiveRecord was introduced, my entire class celebrated the fact SQL statements were abstracted away. We could write RUBY and still retrieve the same data, AUTOMAGICALLY. But let&#8217;s face it&#8230; SQL will always be around.</p>

<p><strong>What do you do when you have a huge app running with over 100 instances,</strong> a mega-goliath database with more migrations and data entries than I&#8217;ve ever seen, and on top of those daunting figures, project managers wanting specific data for metrics.You use a SQL GUI and you write SQL statements.</p>

<p><strong>So this is how I came across a really interesting discovery.</strong> Well two actually: SQL has <code>count</code> and <code>distinct</code> keywords available with which to write queries.</p>

<p>Here is an example of a table I was working on. This table is called photos:
  <img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/photos_table2.png"></p>

<p><strong>I was told to write SQL queries to find the number of photos</strong> that have been uploaded by users in the last three weeks (so from after June 6), as well as the number of users that have updated photos.</p>

<p><strong>1. Number of photos uploaded by users on or after June 6, 2013:</strong></p>

<p><code>select count(id) from photos where user_id is not null and created_at &gt;= 6/6/2013</code></p>

<p>This command is parsing through the data in our database, finding all instances where a user_id is present (in this case all of them), as well as parsing through the created_at dates to find a match and returning to us that number of photos.
This command should return five, as there are five photos uploaded by users in the sample database.</p>

<p><strong>2. Number of users who have uploaded photos on or after June 6, 2013:</strong></p>

<p>The next query was a little bit more challengeing because I was unaware of the SQL <code>distinct</code> method.</p>

<p>Originally, I had:</p>

<p><code>select count(profile_id) from photos where profile_id is not null and created_at &gt;= 6/6/2013</code></p>

<p> But this query returns five.The problem with this query wasn&#8217;t immediately obvious to me. Count doesn&#8217;t discrimate against repeated entries. There are FIVE cells with a user_id, just not five unique id&#8217;s.</p>

<p>My first thought was the <code>uniq</code> method. Like when you have an array that contains duplicates, you can call <code>uniq</code> on that array to return that array with the duplicates removed. But unique is a reserved word in SQL, and is used to create unique indexes (an index can be created in a table to find data more easily and efficiently). So that&#8217;s when I was introduced to <code>distinct</code>.</p>

<p>With that new knowledge, I was able to correct my first attempt at the query,</p>

<p><code>select count(distinct user_id) from photos where user_id is not null and created_a &gt;= 6/6/2013</code></p>

<p>And that statement returns the correct result, which is three.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-24T21:00:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/06/24/oracle-instant-client</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>So today was my first day as a Software Engineer at Time Inc.</em></strong> I can already tell it&#8217;s going to be such an incredible learning experience, and all we did was environment setup today.</p>

<p><strong>The hardest part about all of this, was setting up the client for an Oracle database.</strong> An Oracle database is an object-relational database management system, which means that it is similar to a relational-database but uses an object-oriented model. Essential, it supports objects, classes and inheritence directly in the database schemas and query language, as well as supports custom data-types and methods.</p>

<p>The process of installing took me roughly 4 hours, even with the help of some great blog guides. So I thought I would give it a go at simplyifying the process even further.</p>

<p><strong>1. The first step is to find your operating system in order to download the necessary components.</strong> I was using a Mac OS X Intel. Those options can be found <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/database/features/instant-client/index-097480.html">here </a>.</p>

<br>


<p><strong>2. Download Instant Client Basic, SDK and SQL*Plus.</strong> SDK stands for software development kit, and is a set of developer tools. SQLPlus is a command line tool for making SQL queries to an Oracle database. Those options can be found <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/intel-macsoft-096467.html">here</a>. One thing I will make note of, I originally tried downloading the latest Version, 11.2.0.3.0, but ended up having to remove all those directories and start over again with Version 10.2.0.4 with the 64-bit package.</p>

<br>


<p><strong>3. When I downloaded the instant client, SDK and SQLPlus, they were already unzipped,</strong> so I was able to bypass that step (I was using OS X, 10.8.5). The next step was to make a directory to store instant client: <code>mkdir ~/opt/oracle</code></p>

<br>


<p><strong>4. Because instant client, SQL*Plus and SDK all download into different directories,</strong> I combined the SQLPlus and SDK directories into the instant client directory, making everything much more compact.</p>

<br>


<p><strong>5. Next, I moved my instantclient directory into my <code>/opt/oracle</code> directory:</strong> <code>mv instantclient /opt/oracle</code></p>

<br>


<p><strong>6. Setting up sym links to the libraries:</strong></p>

<pre><code>  ln -s libclntsh.dylib.10.1 libclntsh.dylib
  ln -s libocci.dylib.10.1 libocci.dylib
</code></pre>

<br>


<p><strong>7. The next step is to set up <code>ORACLE_HOME</code>, <code>NLS_LANG</code> and <code>DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH</code> variables.</strong> I chose to set up my variables inside my .bash_profile:</p>

<pre><code>  export ORACLE_HOME=/opt/oracle
  #export ORACLE_HOME=/usr/local/oracle
  export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ORACLE_HOME/instantclient
  export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
  export SQLPATH=$ORACLE_HOME/instantclient
  export ARCHFLAGS="-arch x86_64"
  export NLS_LANG="AMERICAN_AMERICA.UTF8"
  export TNS_ADMIN=$ORACLE_HOME/network/admin
  export PATH=$PATH:$MAVEN_HOME/bin:$SVN_HOME/bin:$GIT_HOME/bin:$AMQ_PATH/bin:$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, these paths will change base on your own selection for directory names.</p>

<br>


<p><strong>8. The final step is to put SQL*Plus in your $PATH.</strong> I did this by creating a symlink (I already had usr/local/bin in my $PATH)</p>

<pre><code>  ln -s /opt/oracle/instantclient/sqlplus /usr/local/bin/sqlplus
</code></pre>

<p>You can test to make sure this works by running <code>which sqlplus</code>, which should return <code>/usr/local/bin/sqlplus</code></p>

<p><strong>9. The final step is to test it all out! Try running <code>gem install ruby-oci8</code></strong> and Oracle instant client should be all set up!</p>

    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/06/05/pluck</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Recently during a pairing session, I learned about the ActiveRecord query, <code>pluck</code>.</em></strong> Essentially, it performs a single column select and returns an array of that data.</p>

<p>Say you have a Person class, and you want to select all the names for everyone in that class, all you would need to call is:</p>

<pre><code>  Person.pluck(:name)
  =&gt;["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, this is like calling,</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT name FROM person;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>pluck</code> to replace using <code>collect</code> and <code>map</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  Person.select(:name).map { |p| p.name }
  =&gt;["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]
</code></pre>

<p>Instead,</p>

<pre><code>  Person.pluck(:name)
  =&gt;["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>pluck</code> in this case is far more efficient than using map to return the same set of results. In the example with <code>map</code>, a full ActiveRecord Person record is returned and then the map is performed. <code>pluck</code> works directly at a database level, and only queries for exactly the information requested.</p>

    <link href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/05/13/respond-to/"/>
    <updated>2013-05-13T12:01:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/05/13/respond-to</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last post was about <code>method_missing</code>. Since that post, I&#8217;ve gotten to play around with <code>method_missing</code> a lot, and think I&#8217;ve begun to grasp its power. It&#8217;s a crazy tool, and one that can be dangerous if not used wisely.</p>

<p>One thing I learned while rewriting the functionality of <code>method_missing</code> is that you must reopen and rewrite <code>respond_to</code> as well. <code>respond_to</code> is used to determine if an object responds to a method, i.e. allows the object to know a method is being called on it.</p>

<p>Becase <code>method_missing</code> allows you to call undefined methods, the object needs to know in some capicty what those are.
In the below example, I have written <code>method_missing</code> to be able to use <code>.get_*</code> and <code>.set_*</code> in order to access object in my database. The method name gets passed as a symbol to method missing, so it must be turned into a string before being used.</p>

<pre><code>def self.method_missing(method_name, *args, &amp;block)
  method_string = method_name.to_s
  if method_string.start_with?("get_")
    #do xyz
  elsif method_string.start)with?("set_")
    #do xyz
  else
    super
  end
end

def self.respond_to?(method_sym, include_private = false)
  if method_sym.to_s =~ /^get_(.*)$/ || method_sym.to_s =~ /^set_(.*)$/
    true
  else
    super
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>respond_to</code> now responds to my version of <code>method_missing</code>. I am essentially searching if the string version of my method includes <code>get_*</code> or <code>set_*</code> and if it does, it is a method that can be called on an object.</p>

<p>The <code>include_private = false</code> is necessary because by default, <code>respond_to</code> must be passed additional parameters to search for private methods. Methods are private for a reason, they don&#8217;t need to be accessed everywhere and by every object.</p>

<p>Also in both <code>method_missing</code> and <code>respond_to</code> my if/else clause ends by calling <code>super</code>. Essentially, if none of the above returns true, go back to your normal functionality and deliver me an error message.</p>

<p>Also note I am using class methods here. My practice with <code>method_missing</code> and <code>respond_to</code> was geared towards reading and writing objects to my database.</p>

    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/05/07/method-missing</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last night I learned about Ruby&#8217;s <code>method_missing</code>.</p>

<p>As Ruby code is executed, it travels up the chain of inheritence to discover where your methods are defined. It will execute the first line of code that matches the method name in the method lookup path.</p>

<p>And of course, when there is an instance where you attempt to call an undefined method, the <code>NoMethodError</code> exception is raised. When this happens, Ruby searches up levels of inheritence until it reaches class BasicObject, which is the parent class of all classes in Ruby. Once it reaches BasicObject and still is unable to find a method, <code>NoMethodError</code> is returned.</p>

<p>This is where <code>method_missing</code> comes in to play. <code>method_missing</code> is a type of metaprogramming that allows programmers to call methods without explicitely defining them.</p>

<pre><code>class Test
  def method_missing(name, *args, &amp;block)
    puts "NAME: #{name}"
    puts "ARG: #{args}"
    puts "BLOCK: #{block}"
  end

end

t = Test.new

t.some_method("arbitrary argument")

#=&gt; NAME: some_method
    ARG: ["arbitrary argument"]
    BLOCK: 
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the only method defined in my class is <code>method_missing</code>. I passed in the method name, optional arguments, and an optional block. Once I instantiate a new instance of the Test class, I call a method <code>some_method</code> on it. But <code>some_method</code> hasn&#8217;t been defined. Normally this would return <code>NoMethodError</code> but because I used <code>method_missing</code>, <code>some_method</code> is accessible to me.</p>

<p>As you can see in my definition of <code>method_missing</code>, I asked it to print out the method name, any potential arguments, and any potential blocks. <code>some_method</code> has method name and an argument, but not a block. Everything I attempted to call on my instance of the Test class is executed thanks to <code>method_missing</code>.</p>

    <updated>2013-05-06T11:06:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/05/06/coding-abroad</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>I just got back from a week vacation in Paris.</em></strong> The highlight of my trip was the day I spent with two different Ruby developers. Through some twitter introductions, I was able to schedule a morning at <a href="http://www.verseauparis.com/">Verseau Paris</a> with founder<a href="http://twitter.com/tracyloisel">Tracy Loisel</a> and an afternoon with <a href="http://twitter.com/tibastral">Thibaut Assus</a>, founder of <a href="http://meetup.rubyparis.org/">Paris.rb</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>It was so incredible to be welcome so whole-heartedly by developers abroad.</em></strong> Tracy was so willing to tell me his story, intrdouce me to his team, and show me around his office. And while there was a little bit of a language barrier (my french isn&#8217;t perfect), coding is international. We both have a story of why we started coding and Ruby provided a common language and basis of understanding. They even posted about me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=521981374527257&set=a.309755622416501.69405.309620859096644&type=1&theater">facebook!</a></p>

<p>  <img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/verseau.jpg"></p>

<p><strong><em>I had a very similiar experience in the afternoon with Thibaut.</em></strong> He welcomed me into his home, told me all about his projects, figured out we knew people in common, and we even laughed about how the PHP array method is bizarre. Commonality.</p>

<p><strong><em>My experience with these developers really hammered home how welcoming the Ruby community is.</em></strong> I am a very new developer, and these amazing developers in Paris were each willing to spend a few hours with me. I don&#8217;t know if you can find that in other industries. It was incredibly reaffirming for me. I am so excited to spend the rest of my life coding. Programming isn&#8217;t people talking to computers, it&#8217;s people talking to people, and bringing people together. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>

    <link href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/04/22/a-lesson-in-linked-lists/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-22T13:43:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/04/22/a-lesson-in-linked-lists</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>This morning, I learned what a linked list is.</em></strong> A linked list is a data structure that is comprised on a group of nodes. Essentially, each dataset is made up of it&#8217;s information, and a pointer. A pointer is a link to the next node in the data sequence. In the simplest of terms, if I am a dataset, I only know about myself, and the person that comes after me.</p>

<p><strong><em>Linked lists are most commonly compared to arrays.</em></strong> They both store data, and both have their pros and cons. In compiled languages, arrays are a fixed size. If you define an array to have 100 elements, it has 100 elements. While there are methods to resize an array in compiled languages, from what I&#8217;ve read, it&#8217;s not an easy task. Linked lists allow for a significantly easier process for inserting and deleting data, without shifting entire groups of elements up or down.</p>

<p><strong><em>So here is an example of a basic link list:</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/linklist1.png"></p>

<p>This small data sequence is going to be listed in alphabetical order. All linked lists start with HEAD, which denotes the begining of the data sequence. The head contains a pointer, which points to the first object in the data set. In this case, HEAD points to &#8220;Boston&#8221;. The first dataset, contains the name of the city, and a pointer to the following dataset, here it is San Fransico. San Francisco points to the end, which is always signified by NULL. The last dataset will always point to NULL.</p>

<p>So in this case, Boston only knows that it exists, and knows about San Fransico. San Francisco only knows they exist, and that NULL exists. They don&#8217;t know anything about Boston.</p>

<p>So the process for inserting another city is fairly simple. Say we wanted to insert New York. Because of the alphabetical order, you will want to insert it between Boston and San Francisco. To do so, all you need to do is make New York point to San Francisco, and change Boston to point to New York. There is no shifting of indexes, or anything like that.</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/linklist2.png"></p>

<p>However the process of searching a linked list is difficult. While in an array, if you were trying to find San Francisco you should simply do <code>array[2]</code> to access San Francisco, it&#8217;s a much more expensive process in linked lists. In this final example, in order to search for San Francisco, you have to start at head, move through Boston and New York, to finally arrive at the data you are searching for.</p>

    <link href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/04/10/ruby-marshaling/"/>
    <updated>2013-04-10T14:11:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/04/10/ruby-marshaling</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>As my semester at <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">The Flatiron School</a> winds down,</em></strong> we&#8217;ve been spending our time building our final projects. My group, <a href="tmd.io">Tyler Davis</a>, <a href="dolin.github.com">Danny Olinsky</a>, and <a href="http://jlarusso.github.io/">Jesse La Russo</a>, is building a modern-take on an old fashioned gold star board. Aka, you write a blog post? You get a gold star. You finish a Code School course? You get a gold star. We&#8217;ve built in a lot of other functionality (our own authentication and authorization, the ability for users to give each other stars, background cron jobs, etc. etc.), but that&#8217;s the gist of it.</p>

<p><strong><em>The best thing about this whole process</em></strong> has been the things I&#8217;ve learned from the errors we get. In this way, I learned about the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Marshal.html">Ruby Marshal Module</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Marshal Module</em></strong> essentially takes a collection of Ruby Objects and converts them into a byte stream, and then allows it to be stored and accessed elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong><em>One of this big things with our project has been working with APIs</em></strong> in order to automate the processes of giving stars. The Treehouse API was particularly difficult to parse through, so for the time being, I created a dictionary to deal with their objects. Essentially, we want to give a star for every category a user completes.</p>

<pre><code>  @@dictionary = {
  "Website Basics" =&gt; ["Website Basics"],
  "Technology Foundations" =&gt; ['Graphic Basics'],
  "Aesthetic Foundations" =&gt; ["Elements", "Principles", "Color Theory"],
  "HTML" =&gt; ["Introduction", "Text", "Lists", "Links", "Objects", "Tables", "Forms"],
  "CSS Foundations" =&gt; ["Introduction", "Selectors", "Data Types", "Text", "Box Model", "Page Layout", "Printing", "Framework Foundations"],
  "CSS3" =&gt; ["Selectors", "Typography", "Web Fonts", "Borders", "Gradients", "Backgrounds", "Transitions", "Transforms", "Animation", "Multi-Column Layouts", "Media Queries"],
  "Build a Responsive Website" =&gt; ["Introduction to Response Web Design", "Fluid Foundation", "Adaptive Design", "Responsive Design", "Advanced Techniques"],
  "Introduction to Programming" =&gt; ["Basics", "Control Structures", "Objects and Arrays", "Functions"],
  "JavaScript Foundations" =&gt; ["Introduction Variables", "JavaScript Strings", "JavaScript Numbers", "JavaScript Arrays", "JavaScript Functions", "JavaScript Objects"],
  "Ruby Foundations" =&gt; ["Ruby Basics", "Objects, Classes, and Variables", "Ruby Strings", "Ruby Numbers", "Ruby Arrays", "Ruby Hashes", "Ruby Methods", "Ruby Loops", "Ruby Blocks", "Ruby Procs &amp; Lambdas", "Ruby Modules", "Ruby Core", "Standard Library", "Ruby Testing"],
  "Build a Simple Ruby on Rails Application" =&gt; ["Getting Started with Rails", "Rails Frontend Development", "Ruby on Rails Authentication", "Customizing Ruby on Rails Forms", "Writing Tests", "Rails Routing", "Testing the Whole App", "Building the Profile Page", "Rails Deployment"]
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>In this dictionary,</em></strong> the star (which is also the Treehouse badge category) is the key. The values (represented as an array of strings) are all the badges you can earn. Essentially, the values are the requirements a user must fulfill to receive a Treehouse Star. In order to do that, we had to create methods that would parse through the Treehouse API, take a collection of all a user&#8217;s badges, and iterate those badges through our dictionary.</p>

<pre><code>  def check_star_requirement(th_json)
    #check json of badge names on profile
    badges = th_json["badges"].collect { |badge| badge["name"] }
    completed_stars_array = @@dictionary.each do |star, requirement|
      star if check_requirements(badges, requirement) 
    end
    completed_stars_array.compact
  end

  def check_requirements(badges, requirement)
    (badges &amp; requirement) == requirement
  end 
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>check_star_requirement</code> methodtakes the Treehose json for a user (in my case, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/victoriafriedman.json">teamtreehouse.victoriafriedman.json</a>), iterates through their information on the Treehouse API and collects all their badges. Those badges are saved in an array called <code>badges</code>. Then the dictionary is saved as an array, <code>completed_stars_array</code> and iterated through.</p>

<p>It then calls the <code>check_requirements</code> method, which iterates through the values of the dictionary. If the strings in <code>badges</code> matches any of values in <code>dictionary</code>, then a user will receive that star.</p>

<p>All of this seemed to be working great until we checked our database. Rails &#8220;marshaled&#8221; our data. An individual entry in our Star table in the Name column, looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>  Aesthetic Foundations
    - Elements
    - Principles
    - Color Theory
</code></pre>

<p>Avi pointed us towards the Ruby Marshaling Module. Essentially, Ruby was taking our entire collection, our dictionary, and transforming each key-value pair into a string (which apparently looked like the above example). We were essentially calling, <code>Marshal::Dump</code>, which saves the data and returns the original string. Because the <code>each</code> method also just returns the original string, our iteration wasn&#8217;t just saving the key, <code>Aesthetic Foundations</code>, to our database, but the entire string.</p>

<p>Our solution to this problem was really simple, essentially we replaced <code>each</code> with <code>collect</code>. Collect returns the new array, so in our case, it returns an array of key values in the dictionary, but only the key where values are all contained in the badges array.</p>

    <updated>2013-04-01T21:17:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/04/01/deleting-crontab-system-mail</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Last week, I presented an app to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/">NYC on Rails</a>.</em></strong> The main focus was to learn about ActionMailer, paired with cron jobs and the <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">Whenever gem</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The hardest part of all of it was configuring the cron log</em></strong> to write to the correct files. I was getting permission errors when trying to get cron to write to the log directly in my application. In the end, I managed to configure the crontab to print errors to a directy of my computer.</p>

<pre><code>set :cron_log, "~/log/cron_log.log"
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>While this gave cron proper permissions</em></strong> and allowed me to debug during development, I ended up 283 system emails on my computer, sent directly to victoria@victoria-miranda-friedman&#8217;s-macbook. And I had no idea how to remove them from my root directory.</p>

<p>Every time I entered terminal, I saw this message:</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/youve_got_mail.png"></p>

<p>In order to enter your mailbox, type <code>mail</code>. This will display:</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/mail_display.png"></p>

<p>The return in terminal clearly tells you <code>Type ? for help.</code>, which returns a list of all possible methods to act on your mailbox and its contents</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/mail_options.png"></p>

<p>And from here, you get clear instructions on how to delete your mail. To delete one email, enter <code>d 1</code>. If you wanted to delete ten emails, you would enter <code>d 1-10</code>, or in my first attempt <code>d 1-283</code>.</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/delete.png"></p>

<p>The next thing I learned about cron mail, was that <code>exit</code>, exits you from your inbox, but doesn&#8217;t save any changes. <code>quit</code> is the command that saves and exits. And as you can see in the image above, after I <code>quit</code> and then entered my mailbox again, I&#8217;m told <code>no mail for victoria</code></p>

    <link href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/24/action-mailer-configurations/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-24T16:26:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/24/action-mailer-configurations</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week, I started working on a presentation with two other girls, <a href="http://1aurabrown.github.com/">Laura Brown</a> and <a href="http://anabecker.tumblr.com/">Ana Becker</a> to present at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/">NYC on Rails</a> meetup this coming Thursday (March 28). Our app revolves around using <a href ="http://rubygems.org/gems/actionmailer"> ActionMailer</a>. And this was the first time I&#8217;ve tried to use the gem.</p>

<p>The documentation for it is really good, and the implementation doesn&#8217;t require too many steps. <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html">RailsGuides</a> has a great step by step breakdown of the entire process, inluding the steps for generating a Mailer.</p>

<p>All of that was easy. I only wanted to render a default template in my view, and am staying away from user authentication.</p>

<p>My problem fell in the configurations. I had no idea that I had to setup SMTP configurations to send my email. And then once I figured that out, where do I enter my specific configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <br>
At first we weren&#8217;t getting any errors. It seemed as if our app was sending emails&#8230;but no one was getting any of them. The first thing we had to do was edit <code>config/evironments/development.rb</code>. That file contains the line:</p>

<pre><code>  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false
</code></pre>

<p>which needs to be changed to read:</p>

<pre><code>  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
</code></pre>

<p>And then we started to get errors we could work from.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <br>
Because we&#8217;re using a Gmail account for our gem, we had to configure ActionMailer specifically for that account. The first step to that was to include the following two lines:</p>

<pre><code>config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
</code></pre>

<p>These lines delcares that SMTP will deliver our emails. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. This protocol also has a layer of authentication built into it&#8217;s functionality</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
The next step is to declare your specific SMTP configurations.</p>

<pre><code> config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  :address =&gt; 'smtp.gmail.com',
  :port =&gt; 587,
  :domain =&gt; 'localhost:3000',
  :authentication =&gt; :plain,
  :user_name =&gt; '&lt;email_address&gt;',
  :password =&gt; '&lt;email_password&gt;',
  :authentication =&gt; 'plain',
  :enable_starttls_auto =&gt; true
}
</code></pre>

<p>These configurations state that we&#8217;re using Gmail, we&#8217;re running our app on localhost:3000, and also includes the email address and password for that account that are associated with the app. The last two lines of the settings handle the authentication of the email account.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>

    <link href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/17/inheritence/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-17T16:57:00-04:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/17/inheritence</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One of the big differences between Ruby and other object oriented languages is that a class in Ruby can inherit from one and only one class. Essentially, each class can only have one parent, but many children.</p>

<p>A great example to understand basic inheritence is to think about it in terms of animals. A cat is a mammal. And all mammals are animals. To break this down in Ruby, that inheritence would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal
end

class Mammal &lt; Animal
end

class Cat &lt; Mammal
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>&lt;</code> denotes inheritence. In this example, the class Cat inherits all the properties from the Mammal class, as well as the Animal class.</p>

<pre><code>class Animal

  def breathe
    "inhale"
  end
end

class Mammal &lt; Animal

  def hair
    "Mammals are the only category of animals that have true hair"
  end
end

class Cat &lt; Mammal

  def meow
    "MEOW"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, all instances of the Cat class say &#8220;MEOW&#8221;, have true hair, and breathe. However, they only inherit directly from Mammal, and Mammal only directly inherits from Animal. No instances of Mammal say &#8220;MEOW&#8221;.</p>

<p>Another great way to extend functionality to a class in Ruby is through the use of Modules.</p>

<p>A Module is a collection of methods and constants.  A module is made up of resuable code that doesn&#8217;t naturally form a class. Because it is not a class, a module can&#8217;t have instance methods.</p>

<p>Modules allow you to implement mixins. A mixin is a way to either include or extend the functionality of your Module to mulitple Ruby classes.</p>

<p>When you Include a module in a class you are including the module methods as instance methods of that class. When you Extend a module in a class, you are adding the module methods as class methods. Essentially, when you declare <code>extend</code> in your classes, you are saying <code>self.extend</code>.</p>

<p>I found a great example of this functionality in action via <a href="http://rubysource.com/ruby-mixins-2/">Ruby Source</a>.</p>

<pre><code>module Logging
  def logger
    @logger ||= Logger.new(opts)
  end
end

class Person
  include Logging
    def relocate
      logger.debug "Relocating person..."
        # do relocation stuff
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the Logging module provides an instance of a logger (<code>@logger</code>). Because class Person includes the Logging module, all of it&#8217;s methods are mixed-in as instances methods. The method logger is now a method that acts on all instances of the Person class.</p>

<p>Another option is to extend the Logger module:</p>

<pre><code>  module Logging

    def logger
      @@logger ||= Logger.new(opts)
    end

  end

  class Person
    extend Logging

      def relocate
        Person.logger.debug "Relocating person..."

        # could also access it with this

        self.class.logger.debug "Relocating person..."

      end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the Logger module as a class variable <code>@@logger</code> which allows this module to be extended to multiple classes. Because the module is extended to the class Person, the method defined in the module can only be called on the class itself, here it is demonstrated in two ways:</p>

<pre><code>Person.logger.debug
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>self.logger.debug
</code></pre>

    <link href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/06/webserver-102/"/>
    <updated>2013-03-06T17:50:00-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/06/webserver-102</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><strong>In my last <a href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/03/webserver-101/">post</a>, I explained how to create a webserver<strong> using <a href="www.dediserve.com">Dediserve.com</a>. [NB: Dediserve.com is the cloud provider]. This post will cover the second half of the webserver setup, including installing gems, deploying with Capistrano, generating SSH keys on github, installing Passenger, and installing and configuring nginx.</p>

<p>Now that you have a server that you can connect to, it&#8217;s time to set it up to run your application on it.</p>

<h3>Prepping to Deploy </h3>


<p>The first step in this process is install the <code>build-essential</code> package (which installs all the developer tools that your Ubuntu Server does not automatically come with, including <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code>), as well as a Ruby 1.9, Rubygems and their development packages, and PostgresSQL (our database server).</p>

<p>In order to install all of these, you must run <code>apt-get</code>, which is Ubuntu&#8217;s management system. This system also speeds up the download process. Instead of spending days running around to all the necessary FTP servers, and then fetch and compile their packages, <code>apt-get</code> takes mere minutes. To get the correct version of this management system, run this command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>Once the update has completed, you&#8217;ll want to install the system.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Press <code>enter</code> when you are prompted to confirm.</p>

<p>The next step is to install the <code>build-essential</code> package.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by the Ruby packages</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3 sqlite3 libsqlite3-ruby libsqlite3-dev
</code></pre>

<p>This installs Ruby 1.9.3, SQLite3 and all of the libraries associated with SQLite3. Ruby and SQLite3 are necessary in order to get a functioning basic Rails application.</p>

<p>Once all of these are installed, you&#8217;ll need to install all of the dependant gems. I used Bundle for my gem management.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install bundler
</code></pre>

<p>Then the <code>SQLite3</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3 sinatra
</code></pre>

<p>When creating this server, I was using a Sinatra application. If you are trying to use this process to set up your server for a Rails app, you would run <code>sudo gem install sqlite3 rails</code>.</p>

<p>I also used <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Passenger</a>, which is a rack app server for Ruby and Python using Nginx. It essentially handles all the heavy lifting for managing your apps processes and resources. This means it makes deploying your app as seamless as possible. Nginx is an open-source web server for HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP protocols, and is quickly approaching Apache as the most popular. Because Nginx takes an event driven approach, they can handle higher loads of requests.</p>

<p>To install Passenger:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install passenger
</code></pre>

<h3> Capistrano  </h3>


<p>Capistrano is an open source tool which executes commands on multiple remote servers, concurrently, and is primarily used for deploying applications.</p>

<pre><code>gem install capistrano
</code></pre>

<p>There are two commands available with Capistrano.<br>
<code>capify</code>: used to prepare your application to be deployed using Capistrano<br>
<code>cap</code>: used to actually deploy your application</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure you&#8217;re in your repository&#8217;s directory before you run any Capistrano commands. From there, enter</p>

<pre><code>capify
</code></pre>

<p>This command creates a <code>capfile</code> and creates a directory called <code>config</code>. This directory contains a file called <code>deploy.rb</code>. The <code>capfile</code> is where the <code>cap</code> command accesses it&#8217;s configurations.</p>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to edit the <code>config/deploy.rb</code> file. These edits will enable us deploy our application.</p>

<pre><code>require 'bundler/capistrano' # for bundler support

set :application, "studentbody"
set :repository,  "GITHUB_REPOSITORY"

set :user, 'USERNAME'
set :deploy_to, "/home/#{ user }/#{ application }"
set :use_sudo, false

set :scm, :git

default_run_options[:pty] = true

role :web, "96.8.123.64"                          # Your HTTP server, Apache/etc
role :app, "96.8.123.64"                          # This may be the same as your `Web` server

# if you want to clean up old releases on each deploy uncomment this:
# after "deploy:restart", "deploy:cleanup"

# if you're still using the script/reaper helper you will need
# these http://github.com/rails/irs_process_scripts

# If you are using Passenger mod_rails uncomment this:
namespace :deploy do
 task :start do ; end
 task :stop do ; end
 task :restart, :roles =&gt; :app, :except =&gt; { :no_release =&gt; true } do
   run "#{try_sudo} touch #{File.join(current_path,'tmp','restart.txt')}"
 end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This file is all written in Ruby, just with Capistrano syntax. In this file, we set these variables: <br>
<code>application</code>: the name of our application.<br>
<code>repository</code>: the URL for the repository on Github. This needs to be replaced with yours. <br>
<code>deploy_to</code>: The location on the remote server where we will deploy the application.<br>
<code>use_sudo</code>: set to false because deploying to a location we own.<br>
<code>user</code>: the user that we created to log into our server.<br>
<code>scm</code>: the source-code-management system we&#8217;re using (in my case, Git).<br>
<code>default_run_options[:pty] = true.</code>: need to ensure that Capistrano interacts with our terminal correctly.<br>
<code>role</code>: We define two roles, both the web and app roles- to manage both the database and the application.<br>
Uncomment <code>:deploy</code> because Capistrano is task-oriented. Here we uncommented starting, stopping, and resetting our application via the Passenger interface.<br>
<code>require 'bundler/capistrano</code>: To ensure Bundler support.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure that both the <code>capfile</code> and  <code>config/deploy.rb</code> are committed and pushed to your github repository.</p>

<h3> Generating an SSH Key </h3>


<p>If you are deploying your application from a private Github repository, you will need to generate a SSH key to act as your &#8220;deploy key&#8221;. This gives your server authentication to access your repository, without you manually entering your github name and password.</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
</code></pre>

<p>This create a key with the type of &#8220;RSA&#8221; (a global standard for encryption) and makes the key size 4096 bits (a veryyyy strong key).</p>

<p>You will be prompted for the location of the file and for a password. DO NOT set a password for this key. A password completely defeats the purpose of the key in the first place.</p>

<p>This key generates two files:
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>: your private RSA key
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>: your public RSA key. This key is ok to distribute.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to enter your private key into your github settings.</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/github_setting.png"></p>

<p>Once there, select the SSH Key option from the menu on the left of the page.</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/ssh.png"></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll then want to select &#8220;Add SSH Key&#8221; and copy and paste your private SSH Key there. You don&#8217;t need to title it. Github will automatically generate a title to match your server. Make sure you save!</p>

<p><img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/new_key.png"></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll then want to add the contents of your public key to your server</p>

<pre><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>

<h3> Preparing to Deploy AND Actually Deploying!</h3>


<p>Because Capistrano has a full deployment framework built in, the first step is to ensure that it&#8217;s file structure is in place to deploy your app. In your terminal from the repository&#8217;s directory, run</p>

<pre><code>cap deploy:setup
</code></pre>

<p>This command will connect to your server, prompt you for your password, and create the necessary directory structure on your server.</p>

<p>It creates a very simple file structure:</p>

<pre><code>/home/USERNAME/repository/
releases/
shared/
</code></pre>

<p>When your application is deployed, your github repository is copied into your <code>releases/</code> directory. A symbolic link is created from that directory to the directory of your application, and names it <code>current</code>. This allows you to release updates of your code while still tracking older versions.</p>

<p>Once your github repository is up to date, you can deploy in one simple command</p>

<pre><code>cap deploy
</code></pre>

<h3> Nginx In&#8217;s and Out&#8217;s </h3>


<p>Nginx is the actual webserver. It speaks HTTP and sits between the client (typically a browser) and your application. Passenger interacts with Nginx by starting up several &#8220;handlers&#8221; for your application. This means that several instances of your application will be running all at once. This allows your server to handle multiple requests to your server per second. This also ensures that each instance of your application is only handling once request at a time. Nginx speeds up and smooths out this process.</p>

<p>Passenger has partly configured Nginx for us, but to finish it off, you&#8217;ll want to edit <code>/opt/nginx/conf.</code> using vim. Vim is a text editor that you can load in your terminal.</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Once this file is open, you&#8217;ll want to make the following changes:</p>

<p><code>#user  nobody;</code> You will need to uncomment out this line and change it to read <code>user www-data;</code>.</p>

<p>Then you&#8217;ll want to find the block that reads:</p>

<pre><code>location / {
  root   html;
  index  index.html index.htm;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And edit it to read:</p>

<pre><code>root /home/USERNAME/APPNAME/current/public;
passenger_enabled on;
</code></pre>

<p>Nginx can be stopped and started by running</p>

<pre><code>/opt/nginx/sbin/nginx
</code></pre>

<p>But because this command is long, you can create a shorten it to <code>nginx</code> by creating a symlink (symbolic link).</p>

<p>Terminal controlls Unix systems by navigating through paths. A path is a series of directories that denote a specific location. To inspect your current path, run</p>

<pre><code>printenv PATH
</code></pre>

<p>You should get a response that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
</code></pre>

<p>We will want to place the symlink to nginx in <code>/usr/local/sbin</code> becuase, by default, <code>/usr/local</code> is the location that administrators should put any programs that aren&#8217;t automatically installed by your package managers. To do so,</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /opt/nginx/sbin/nginx /usr/local/sbin/
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>nginx -h</code> will display all the series of arguments associated with the <code>nginx</code> command.</p>

<p>To start Nginx, enter</p>

<pre><code>sudo nginx
</code></pre>

<p>This should automatically return your prompt. Nginx spawns a connection in the background so that you can continue to work directly on your server. Once it&#8217;s running, you should be able to access your application by going to</p>

<pre><code>http://YOUR-IP
</code></pre>

<p>To stop Nginx, enter</p>

<pre><code>sudo nginx -s stop
</code></pre>

<p>And that&#8217;s it! Your application has been deployed to your very own server!
Congratulations!!</p>

<p><strong>I can&#8217;t believe how much I&#8217;ve learned in 19 days of class.<strong> My last blog post was about understanding iterations, and now it&#8217;s hard to image a time when that didn&#8217;t make sense to me.</p>

<p> <ul> Highlights of the last few weeks include:
  <li> Hearing <a href="http://steveklabnik.com/"> Steve Klabnik </a> speak about contributing to open source projects and his work on Rails. </li>
  <li> Building my own webserver on <a href="www.dediserve.com"> Dediserve.com </a> with the help of <a href="http://spike.grobste.in/"> Spike Grobstein </a> </li>
  <li> Understanding the breakdown of a MVC. I will never complain about my facebook page taking an extra 2 seconds to load ever again, especially on my mobile device. It really is like magic. </li>
  <li> Learning rails week 1. and my first rails app. </li>
</ul></p>

<p>  While everything I&#8217;ve learned has been absolutely mind blowing, the thing that really hit home for me was how intricate a process it is just to log into facebook, twitter or online banking and have my information load in miliseconds. Along with appreciating how much work just goes into the design and coding to create the page, I also have a deep appreciate for Sysadmins, who&#8217;s sole role is to keep your site up and running on a live server. Building a web server and grasping the complexity of the call and response that goes on behind the spaces was eye-opening. This post will cover setting up your server, connecting to it for the first time, creating your own user, as well as disabling your insecure root user. [NB: Stay tuned for follow ups about installing gems, deploying with Capistrano, generating SSH keys on github, installing Passenger, and installing and configuring nginx].</p>

<p>  <strong>So what is a web server? A web server </strong> is a combination of both hardware and software that acts as a host to content, and delivers that content in the form of HTML through HTTP to the client, which in most cases is the browser.</p>

<h3> Creating your Server </h3>


<p>  <p>We used <a href="www.dediserve.com" alt="Dediserve's Website"> Dediserve.com </a> as our cloud provider. They offer extensive Linux based distributions. In specific, we used Linxu&#8217;s Ubuntu distribution, which is one of the most popular in use today. </p></p>

<p>  <p>Once you create an account on Dediserve.com, you&#8217;ll want to select &#8220;Cloud Nodes&#8221; in the Client Area. </p></p>

<p>  <p> Once there, you&#8217;ll be prompted to select a server hostname, a password for your server, what OS templace you would like (in this case, we used Ubuntu 12.04 x64), as well as bandwidth, disk space, memory, and CPU cores.</p></p>

<p>  <p>Once finished, Dediserve will automate an IP address for you. </p></p>

<p>  <img src="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/Dediserve.png"></p>

<p>  <p><strong> An IP address is a unique set of numbers </strong> that represents a location for your server in the cloud. Every server has an IP address and every computer has an IP address. The IP addresses are what the server and computers use to find each other and communicate back and forth. </p></p>

<p>  <p> Dediserve will automatically generate your selected password as the password for the root user (or default administrator) for your server. This user has no restrictions in terms of access. Because of this, it&#8217;s considered bad practice to use this as your regular log-on. In terms of security of your server, this user is considerd insecure because it provides the easiest path for someone to hack on to your server. (Keep reading to learn how to disable the root user). </p></p>

<h3> Connecting to Your Server </h3>


<p>  </p>The next step is to create a connection to your server, using SSH. SSH stands for Secure SHell and is a way to conenct remotely to your server via commandline: </p></p>

<pre><code>`ssh root@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX`
</code></pre>

<p> replace the XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX with your server&#8217;s IP address.</p>

<p>You should get a prompt delcaring that the &#8216;authenticity of host can&#8217;t be established&#8217;. Type <code>yes</code> and you will be prompted for password for your server. Once you submit the password, you&#8217;re connected!!</p>

<h3> Creating Your Own User </h3>


<p>The next step is to create your own user admin, which will override the root user. To do so, you will use the <code>useradd</code> command.
<code>useradd --help</code> will bring up a list of options, including <code>s &lt;shell&gt;</code>, <code>-G &lt;groups&gt;</code>, and  <code>m</code>. The <code>--help</code> argument provides a list of argument options, as well as instructions for how to use them.</p>

<p>We will want to run <code>useradd -s /bin/bash -G sudo -m USERNAME</code>. This command adds a user to your server, selects Bash as your commandline interface, adds <code>sudo</code> (or Super User Do) to your group giving your new admin full access, and then finally your new username is added to the home directory.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure and replace <code>USERNAME</code> with the username that you would like to use.
Then you&#8217;ll need to create a password for your user by entering <code>passwd USERNAME</code>.</p>

<p><code>exit</code> will allow you to disconnect from your server. Then, relog in with you IP address, but this time prefixing it with your new username.</p>

<pre><code>ssh USERNAME@XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
</code></pre>

<h3> Disconnecting/Disabling Root User Login </h3>


<p>Now, you&#8217;ll need to disconnect your root user&#8217;s ability to SSH into your server. The first step in this process is to edit your <code>ssh_config</code> file.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll open this file by entering:</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
</code></pre>

<p><code>sudo</code> calls the super-powers to override security, <code>vim</code> is a text editor that runs within commmandline, and <code>etc/ssh/sshd_config</code> is the path to the configuration file.</p>

<p>Once the file is open, you&#8217;ll need to locate the line,
  <code>PermitRootLogin yes</code></p>

<p>and change it to read
  <code>PermitRootLogin no</code></p>

<p>To save and quit the file enter <code>:wq</code>. This will both write to the file (and save it) as well as quit vim.</p>

<p>The final step to disable the root user is to restart the <code>sshd</code> process</p>

<p>  <code>sudo /etc/init.d/ssh restart</code></p>

<p>Now if you try to login as <code>root</code>, you will be denied access to the server. You should get an incorrect password error. This will delay anyone trying to hack onto your server by simply wasting their time.</p>

<p>Stay tune for Part Two, deploying to your server!</p>

<p><strong>Today marks day 9 into my 60 day course</strong> at <a href="flatironschool.com"> the Flatiron School. </a> Essentially, I&#8217;m 15% done. I would best summarize the last 9 days with these simple words: anxiety, frustration, and (sometimes) victory.<p>

<p><strong>The thing about this course,</strong> essentially a &#8220;full-immersion language course&#8221;, is the pace in which things are taught. It&#8217;s fast. I was prepared for fast, but not this fast. We&#8217;ve been told from day one, &#8220;If you don&#8217;t understand something now, don&#8217;t worry. You will use these methods for the rest of your life, and at some point, they will make sense.&#8221; I&#8217;m not used to moving on to new material before I grasp the current material, but we&#8217;ve also been told to trust the structure of the program, so I have.</p>

<p><strong>So each day has been filled with new material,</strong> and thus new frustrations. A day hasn&#8217;t gone by where I&#8217;ve been utterly and completely lost. I don&#8217;t want to define myself as the potential crier for the class, but&#8230;.I could be.</p>

<p><strong>Yesterday, after spending close to three hours on homework,</strong> I called it a night. And then something happened, a moment of realization. I UNDERSTAND ITERATIONS. Two days prior, literally a mere 48 hours, iterations were some mystical thing that I was struggling to grasp. And without even realizing it, I had been using the each method with ease in my programs. AND I DIDN&#8217;T EVEN REALIZE THAT I UNDERSTOOD THEM. The pace of the class kept me from noticing when material had sunk in.</p>

<p><strong>And with that introduction, I give you the each method.</strong></p>

<p>Say you have an array of candy:</p>

<img src ="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/array.png" alt ="Image of and array containing reeces, twizzlers, mambas and snickers">


<p>The each method iterates, or loops, through each item in an array. In layman&#8217;s terms, the method acts as a pointer and moves through the array, first to &#8220;reeces&#8221;, then to &#8220;twizzlers&#8221;, then &#8220;mambas&#8221;, and finally to &#8220;snickers&#8221;. Objects that can be iterated through are called enumerables. In Ruby, strings, hashes, and arrays are all enumerators.</p>

Once the array has been defined, we can implement the each method on that array.
The each method only returns the original array, meaning all it does is move through each index. Nothing is actually done to or with the data, and no new array is created.

<img src ="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/array_each_do.png" alt ="Image of and array containing reeces, twizzlers, mambas and snickers">


<p>However, you can do things like this: </p>

<img src ="http://vicfriedman.github.com/images/post_images/array_puts.png" alt ="Image of and array containing reeces, twizzlers, mambas and snickers">


<p>Here I added a puts in my block of code. The |candy| refers to each type of candy included my array. In my string, I refer back to each individual instance of candy, which then includes it in the string.
But take note of the actual return value from Ruby, it is still the original array. Again, the each method does not do anything to the original array, it simply takes stock of each item in the array as it passes through and implements the code included in the block (which here is to puts my string).</p>

<h1>5 Things I&#8217;ve Learned About Myself While Learning to Code:</h1>


<ul style="list-style:none">
<p><li><strong>1. I need physical activity in order to well sleep at night.</strong> This statement rang true even when I was doing the prework for the <a href="http://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a>. I&#8217;m an active girl, and now I&#8217;m sitting for 10-12 hours a day. I had no idea the effect this sudden change would have on me. And oh the sleepless nights. Even when all my work is said and done, I can&#8217;t seem to go to bed before 2am. The moral of the story is that I need to be more diligent about the gym. And here&#8217;s the catch-22: I would rather spend my time hacking and reading about hacking than anything else. <li></p>


<p><li><strong>2. I am prideful.</strong> Sure everyone has pride, but I did not realize to what extent I exalted my own mental capacity, until eight days ago. My class is smart. So imagine a class of dedicated brainiacs. Imagine sitting in that room during lecture feeling so horribly lost. Do you really want to be the girl to raise your hand and say &#8220;I have no idea what&#8217;s going on. Can you please re-explain?&#8221; It&#8217;s a terrifying concept. It&#8217;s admitting defeat. The feeling exactly mirrors that of saying &#8220;I am dumb.&#8221; That&#8217;s pride rising to the surface. And it&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve had to work on getting over, because otherwise I&#8217;ll never learn.</li></p>


<p><li><strong>3. The highs beat all the lows.</strong> I spend most of my day with error messages, and that&#8217;s not an exageration. I am a Ruby Newbie, and proud of it. Those error messages, paired with overwhelming feelings of frustration and discouragement, and an ever present desire to bang my head into a wall makes my victories that much sweeter. And yes, I wrote my first Ruby program today. It took four people over an hour, but you can bet that I&#8217;m calling my mom as soon as I get home to brag.</li></p>


<p><li><strong>4. It&#8217;s hard to take the training wheels off and just ride.</strong> I have two incredible teachers who are great resources for all my coding questions. And my computer is this expensive machine, that some part of me is still afraid to break with one single rm -rf (and I didn&#8217;t even know I could do that until one month ago). So I&#8217;ve hesitated in trying things on my own. &#8220;What if I ruin all of it? What if my computer just bursts into a million pieces?&#8221; The list of irrational fears goes on. And here&#8217;s the thing, I&#8217;ve already made a huge jump in being at the Flatiron School in the first place. I threw my training wheels to the curb the second I signed myself up for these 12 intense weeks. So why stop now? Yes it&#8217;s hard. Yes, it&#8217;s scary. But won&#8217;t I be that much of a better person by the end of all of this by claiming it as my own? The Flatiron School celebrates failure, and so do I.</li></p>


<p><li><strong>5. Time flies when you&#8217;re having fun.</strong> This past Friday, we were given one hour to work on an assignment between blocks of lectures. And literally before I knew it, we were called back to lecture. I had barely even looked up from my computer. I hadn&#8217;t registered a single thing from the outside world, other than the six words I had composed that were hopefully going to turn into a successful method. It didn&#8217;t. I actually got the entire problem wrong, but that&#8217;s ok. Because the thing I took from that hour is that in 5 days of class, coding has become a part of me. I have never been able to do anything with such uninterrupted vigor ever. And this is just the beginning.</li></p>
</ul>
