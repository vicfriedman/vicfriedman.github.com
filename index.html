<p><strong><em>The Nuts and Bolts:</em></strong>
<strong>About six months ago</strong> I joined <a href="https://flatironschool.com">Flatiron School</a> to start something really awesome&#8230;a program to teach high school students to code. After teaching over 100 students this summer during six two-week camps and the preparations for our <a href="https://after.flatironschool.com/">after school programs</a> I&#8217;ve learned a lot about teaching and coding.</p>

<h2><strong><em>CLI:</em></strong></h2>

<p>When I learned command line, it felt like a necessary evil. This thing I had to learn in order to get to the cool stuff. I wanted to build web apps that people would use and think were awesome. But before that, I had to learn CLI and git and sql and all this <em>stuff</em>. That&#8217;s like 3 languages before you even get to the good stuff.</p>

<p>At Flatiron School, we don&#8217;t teach coding in contrived environments. Not for our adult immersives, and definitely not for our high school programs. We want give our students the ability to use real tools to build real things. Which means, again&#8230;teaching our students to use terminal like the pros. But it sort of seems to suck.</p>

<h3><strong><em>How It&#8217;s Taught Now</em></strong></h3>

<p>The best guide available online is Zed Shaw&#8217;s <a href="http://cli.learncodethehardway.org/book/">Learn CLI the Hard Way</a>.It&#8217;s actually a great tutorial to master the commands. It&#8217;s how I learned. But let&#8217;s think about it for a second. A class of 20 fifteen-year-olds will eat you alive if you hand them that and say &#8220;type &#8216;mkdir director_name&#8217; 10 times, followed by &#8216;rm -r directory_name&#8217;&#8221;. Especially on day one!</p>

<p>Our students have never coded before. Never even knew that terminal existed on their computer. Didn&#8217;t know that that was life before the GUI. Didn&#8217;t even know what a GUI was. So you can&#8217;t just give them meaningless exercises to learn this potentially really boring thing.</p>

<p>The single most frequently asked question in every class by most every student is &#8220;Why are we learning this? What&#8217;s the point?&#8221;</p>

<h3><strong><em>What Is The Point?!</em></strong></h3>

<p>Command Line provides an incredibly easy interface to your computer. You don&#8217;t spend seconds looking for your lost mouse, clicking icons, waiting for finder to load, waiting for files to load. Typing <code>open Desktop/Development/my_file.rb</code> takes milliseconds! As a developer, your time is expensive, and those seconds you waste navigating through finder add up to minutes and then hours that you waste trying to find and open files. That&#8217;s why we claim the best developers never have to touch a mouse.</p>

<h3><strong><em>So How Do You Make It Interesting??</em></strong></h3>

<p>First and foremost, terminal can&#8217;t be treated as the boring thing. It has to be cool in and of itself.</p>

<p>Here are some points I&#8217;ve tried to emphasize:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> IT&#8217;S NOT SCARY!! You cannot explode your computer into a million pieces just by typing in a bad command. Just bang on the keyboard and press enter. It&#8217;ll be ok I promise.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> A themed story makes a world of difference. I&#8217;ve used the story of saving a princess from a tower. You have to move through the territory ruled by the castle by creating the directories that make up the different areas of the territory as well as create files for the different people and creatures you meet along the way. This story allows students to repeat the commands over and over and over again, but not bore them to death with random pointless files. This way, they&#8217;re on a mission.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> <code>Say</code> command packs a big punch. You can even have the <code>say</code> command read from a file <code>say -f file_name</code>. You can change voices by passing the <code>-v</code> flag with an argument. It would look something like this <code>say -f file-name -v voice_name</code>. Apple provides Bruce, Kathy, Alex, Fred, Victoria, and Vicki as potential different voices.</p>

<p><strong>4.</strong> <code>rm -rf</code> is THE MOST DANGEROUS. But it also make you feel super powerful that you can destroy a computer with four letters and a hyphen.</p>

<p><strong>5.</strong> ALL THE TOYS. Just try typing <code>brew install cmatrix</code>. Once it installs enter <code>cmatrix</code> and install feel like the coolest.</p>

<p><strong><em>Aside</em></strong> You can even incorporate the <code>say</code> command into ruby code. Which is SUPER AWESOME.</p>

<p><strong><em>Disclaimer:</em></strong> I originally wrote this post to give as a lightning talk at RubyConf 2013. I signed up a little too late and there wasn&#8217;t time for me to give it, so I figured it would make a good blog post.</p>

<p><img src="http://community.ubnt.com/ubnt/attachments/ubnt/Lounge/24685/1/bth_bangHeadAgainstWall.gif"/></p>

<p><strong>Hi my name is Victoria Friedman,</strong> and I am a very new member of the Ruby community. I&#8217;ve been programming for less than a year. Seriously, last January I made my brother spend a good 30 minutes explaining absolute versus relative paths to me. So how did I end up here?</p>

<p><strong>I didn&#8217;t come to Ruby from a CS background,</strong> I didn&#8217;t grow up taking apart the toaster oven like my older brother, instead I wrote poems and drew pictures that my mom turned into postcards. I was an English major at a liberal arts college in TN and wanted to be a writer. So programming?</p>

<p><strong>Last February I started a 12 week intensive course in ruby and rails</strong> in New York City called the Flatiron School. And now I&#8217;m a rails developer at Time.</p>

<p><strong>For those of you that knew from an early age that programming was for you,</strong> I applaud you. You&#8217;re so lucky you found your path in life early on. I on the other hand, hit my post-grad quarter life crisis SO hard. Seriously there wasn&#8217;t something I didn&#8217;t try: coaching, writing, fashion, pastry school. Been there, done that. So I came from the most non-traditional background. And the programming way of thinking was not my specialty.</p>

<p><strong>People tend to stick to things they&#8217;re inheritely good at.</strong> I hate things I&#8217;m bad at, which is why I don&#8217;t attempt to paint portraits, or write short fiction stories, or play tennis. I&#8217;m bad at it. I&#8217;m sure I could learn, but what&#8217;s the fun in sucking so badly at something? It&#8217;s demoralizing. The biggest shot to the ego. Especially when you&#8217;re starting &#8220;late in life&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>That fact alone should have made me run in the opposite direction.</strong> I called directories folders, I&#8217;d never heard of a method, and I can&#8217;t believe I&#8217;m about to admit this, but less than a year ago I thought Java was short for Javascript. I was that clueless.</p>

<p><strong>Progamming is HARD. it is the hardest thing I have ever tried to do in my entire life.</strong> Steve Klabnik came and talked to my class at the Flatiron School and I think he described it in the best way I&#8217;ve ever heard &#8220;when you&#8217;re writing code, you&#8217;re fixing things that are broken, when it&#8217;s fixed, you stop. So programming is just like banging your head against a wall, it feels really good when you stop&#8221;</p>

<p><strong>Along with learning to code, and acquiring a job,</strong> The Flatiron School really taught me how to check my ego. And really for the benefit of myself.</p>

<p><strong>The advice I tell anyone learning to code,</strong> especially people going through programs like mine, is to not be afraid to admit when you don&#8217;t know something. Bloomberg will halt a meeting and ask what a word means if someone uses a word he doesn&#8217;t know. I am not nearly as influential as Bloomberg. So why should I be afraid to admit that I hadn&#8217;t seen a lot (if not most) of the metaprogramming examples Steve Harms used in his talk earlier today, and that I had to google what TTL meant yesterday. If you don&#8217;t ask, you&#8217;ll never know. You will never learn it unless you can admit you don&#8217;t know it.</p>

<p><strong>When you learn to code, you spend a lot of time in &#8220;the fog&#8221;,</strong> to quote my teacher from Flatiron, but the more you use something, the more you understand it. I didn&#8217;t think I understood iteration until I realized I was using the each method correctly. I came out of the fog. Over the last 9 months in my learning to code adventures, I&#8217;ve continued to dip into the fog, and then come back out. But what makes it so great is when the lights come on, and the best part about it is you can actually demostrate it. You can build something that didn&#8217;t previously exist.</p>

<p><strong>Last week, I started trying to fix a bug at work&#8230;</strong>and then this week, I was still trying to fix the same bug. I spent FIVE DAYS on the same bug. And then I met a friend after work, and he was able to help me fix it in 25 minutes. So why didn&#8217;t that make me want to cry?  because I&#8217;ve been doing this for nine months, and he&#8217;s been coding in ruby for 4 years and that doesn&#8217;t make him smarter than me, or better than me, or cooler than me. Also he couldn&#8217;t fully explain why what we did fixed the bug. But I met someone here at Rubyconf who could. And now I can go back to the city and explain to my friend.</p>

<p><strong>And that&#8217;s the beauty of the tech industry.</strong> No one can ever know everything there is to know about everything. Somewhere, there is someone that knows more about something than you do, or can do it better. And isn&#8217;t that the entire point of open source projects in the first place? And blogs and helping each other.</p>

<p><strong><code>url_for</code> is a great Rails helper that returns a URL</strong> that has been rewritten according to the options hash passed to it and defined routes. Rails passes all the keys in the options hash to the routing module. There are a few exceptions, including (but not limited to) <code>:only_path</code>, <code>:trailing_slash</code>, and <code>:host</code>. For a full list please see the docs <a href="http://apidock.com/rails/ActionController/Base/url_for">here</a>. <br><br></p>

<pre><code>        &lt;%= url_for :controller =&gt; "recipes", :action =&gt; "show", :id =&gt; 1 %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This would generate a url that looks like this:&#8217;http://domain.com/recipes/show/10&#8217;<br><br></p>

<p><strong>But let&#8217;s say you were trying to generate a URL</strong> for a polymorphic object, or a nested object, or you just want the absolute path. Let&#8217;s take an image object. My image class is polymorphic, and thus belongs to every model as imageable.<br><br></p>

<pre><code>        &lt;%= url_for @image :only_path =&gt; false %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Setting <code>:only_path</code> to false generates the full url instead</strong> of just the relative path. <code>url_for</code> is really like <code>path_for</code>. You have to pass it an additional argument to return the full URL. But that example returns an error: Wrong number of arguments(2 for 1). Essentially in the example above, you&#8217;re passing two arguments&#8211; an object and a hash. <br><br></p>

<p>But, if you only pass one argument, the object…<br><br></p>

<pre><code>            &lt;%=url_for @image %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p><strong>This produces a relative path to the image.</strong> When you pass an ActiveRecord object to url_for, it causes a lookup on the image class, essentially calling @image.to_params, and use image_path to generate the path.<br><br></p>

<p><strong>So how then do you get the full URL</strong> with the domain name without doing some hackey <code>"http://mydomain.com" + &lt; my_query_string_generated_from_url_for &gt;</code> ?<br><br></p>

<p><strong>This is where <code>polymorphic_url</code> comes in.</strong> <code>polymorphic_url</code> is a Rails helper method for calling a named route. It also provides support for nested resources. This helper method is designed to return a full URL, instead of just the relative path, without passing any arguments. If you did want the relative path, <code>polymorphic_path</code> does just that.<br><br></p>

<p>So let&#8217;s say we&#8217;re on an image record<br><br></p>

<pre><code>        &lt;%= polymorphic_url(@image) %&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>That would be the same as calling <code>image_url(@image)</code>. Rails would return &#8220;http://mydomain.com/images/1&#8221;<br><br></p>

<p><strong>So now say you want to access the images from the recipes.</strong> This is where the nested support of polymorphic_url comes into play.<br><br></p>

<pre><code>        &lt;%= polymorphic_url([recipe, image])%&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This would return &#8220;http://mydomain.com/recipes/1/images/1&#8221;<br><br></p>

<p>So when do you use these handy helpers?A path should always be used unless you&#8217;re doing a full redirect.<br><br></p>

<p><strong><em>This is my response to <a href=http://www.techendo.co/posts/are-dev-bootcamps-a-scam-a-hacker-s-perspective>this</a> horrible article arguing against the validity of hacker schools.</em></strong> And I am a huge supporter, because without the Flatiron School, I literally couldn&#8217;t even tell you what I&#8217;d be doing with my life. I wrote a really long response to his article in the comments on that post, and it got removed somehow&#8230;so I decided to re-write it and put it on my blog. So here goes&#8230;</p>

<p><strong>My name is Victoria Friedman and I am</strong> a graduate of the second semester of students from the Flatiron School. Prior to my semester I had absolutely ZERO technical background. I graduated from a liberal arts college and was an English Literature major and a French Literature minor. I love to read and write and play sports and do other creative work (like bake and do crafts projects). I wanted to work in the world of publishing, but editorial work is nearly impossible to get involved with. So I spent two months learning some basic HTML and CSS so that I could apply to online magazines and do more than be able to just write content. And that&#8217;s when I learned about the Flatiron School. I had never been in terminal until this past January. I didn&#8217;t know my elbow from my foot, my left from right. Java? That&#8217;s short for Javascript right? Seriously. That&#8217;s what I thought.</p>

<p><strong>I pretty much dropped everything</strong> the two weeks leading up to the start of the semester and spent around 10 hours a day at school doing the prework, all with the support of Avi and the graduates from the first class. And then the semester started. I should also point out that I was given a scholarship to attend the Flatiron School. I paid NOTHING for three months of learning. which I believe goes against your point of 90k tuitions. Also the Flatiron School&#8217;s tuition is nowhere near there to begin with.</p>

<p><strong>And then the semester started.</strong> I kissed my social life goodbye and buckled down. I struggled immensely with some basic programming concepts. You can read my blog post about understanding iterations and the each method <a href="http://bit.ly/1aVW6M0">here</a> and all my other blog posts that document my learning during the Flatiron School since I&#8217;ve graduated. Two of which have been included in issues of Ruby Weekly.</p>

<p><strong>As far as only having the ability to produce shitty web apps</strong> at the end, I built <a href="http://strboard.com/login"> Starboard</a> with three other students in three weeks. And none of us knew Rails prior. Also, here are some other amazing projects that have come out of the school. Actually, just check out <a href="http://built.flatironschool.com/">Built</a> which is a CMS for all Flatiron student projects THAT WAS ALSO BUILT BY FLATIRON STUDENTS.</p>

<p><strong>At the end of my interview process,</strong> I had more than one job offer. I spent six weeks interviewing and was faced with up to four rounds of interviews with companies, all of which involved technical questions. I was asked to explain the internet, write the reverse method for a string without using .reverse on a whiteboard, construct a multiplayer chess game with thousands of users and describe the caching involved, what a Ruby singleton was, and how inheritance works in javascript. If those are bullshit interview questions, please give me examples of real ones. And I&#8217;m really not sure you can fake answering those questions. I just don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s possible.</p>

<p><strong>I am now a developer at Time Inc</strong> on their Internet Application Development Team. If you want to see some of my work since I&#8217;ve graduated, please go buy an ecbookbook on <a href=myrecipes.com>Myrecipes.com</a>. I built that. I don&#8217;t think you can call the 806th most popular website in the world a shitty web app, and my bosses seem to think I&#8217;m qualified enough to lead development for the site. I single handedly run our rails production deployments, manage project timelines and workflow, attend meetings with the sites stakeholders, all while working in collaboration with a team of 20+ people.
<strong>Yes I make mistakes.</strong> But I also learn from them and never make the same mistake twice. Yes things are hard for me sometimes. But I also know I have an abundance of resources (both inside and outside my company) and a brain to figure it all out. Please show me a programmer who knows everything about every programming language. You can&#8217;t. It&#8217;s impossible. That&#8217;s the beauty of the tech industry, there is always something new to learn.</p>

<p><strong>I&#8217;ve always told people</strong> that my biggest takeaway from my time at the Flatiron School was the ability to learn the things I don&#8217;t know. Because no one will ever know it all.</p>

<p><strong>So please do let me know if you would like to speak with any of my bosses. I can easily put you in touch.</strong></p>

<p>My project at work is interesting because all the teams are very modularized. Yes, we all attend the same standup and have a general idea of what each individual is working on, but that being said the only time I&#8217;m really affected by what our front-end team does is when I have to include new markup on the rails side. I never even see the global.js or global.css files.</p>

<p>This week, I spent a lot of time working with one of our front-end developers. We split the work based on our specific abilities in an attempt to finish this sprint as quickly as possible. So this means she&#8217;s controling the front end of one of our rails forms. I don&#8217;t even have the html for the form in my code base.</p>

<p>So this means in order to make this a form and have the user&#8217;s input save to our database as objects, I had to coordinate the implementation of logic, including knowing what to pass in to the name field of the html for the part of the form the front-end developer controls.</p>

<p>I have three classes:</p>

<pre><code>  class Gift
    has_many :gift_recipients
    has_many :recipients, :through =&gt; :gift_recipients

    accepts_nested_attributes_for :recipients
  end

  class Recipient
    has_many :gift_recipients
    belongs_to :gifts, :through =&gt; :gift_recipients
  end

  class Gift_Recipient
    belongs_to :gifts
    belongs_to :recipients
  end
</code></pre>

<p>My form in my views is used to be create a gift, and part of that form is also creating recipients for that gift. Essentially, a user checks a box and mini form appends to the page by javascript, allowing them to enter in a recipient&#8217;s email and a message.</p>

<p><code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code> allows the creation of a related object along with the main object. So in my example, I&#8217;m creating an instance of my <code>Gift</code> class while simultaneously creating an instance of my <code>Recipient</code> class. There is good documentation on this <a href="http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/NestedAttributes/ClassMethods.html#method-i-accepts_nested_attributes_for">here</a>.</p>

<p>So now what? I don&#8217;t have the html for the recipients section of the form in my code, so I have to use the HMTL <code>name</code> field to pass the user&#8217;s input back to rails to save it in the database. I was familiar how to do this with just an attribute of an object. For an attribute of the gift, it would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;input type="text" name="gift[name]" &gt;
</code></pre>

<p>But how does that change with <code>accepts_nested_attributes_for</code> ?</p>

<pre><code>It's actually fairly simple:

&lt;input type="text" name="gift[recipients_attributes][0][email]"&gt;
&lt;input type="text" name="gift[recipients_attributes][0][message]"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>This would be the input field for an email address for the first instance of <code>Recipient</code>. It follows the typical Rails convention of keeping the associated table name pluralized. The only thing to be aware of, is that the indexing changes based on how many instances of recipients you are creating.</p>

<p>So say my user pushes the button again and wants to create two recipients? The HTML would look a little something like this:</p>

<pre><code>  &lt;input type="text" name="gift[recipients_attributes][1][email]"&gt;
  &lt;input type="text" name="gift[recipients_attributes][1][message]"&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>And voila, on submit, rails understands to create one instance of a gift, as well as two instances of recipients. The through relationship is what attaches my recipients to the gift, so there is naturally an association with that gift to those users.</p>

  </header>


  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>I&#8217;ve recently been reading Object Oriented Javascript per a colleague&#8217;s reccomendation.</em></strong> One thing I got very stuck on, especially coming from Ruby, has been the difference between primitive data types and objects. In Ruby, everything is an object so the concept of primitive data types confused me entirely. Especially this:</p>

<pre><code>  var word = "hello"
  typeof word =&gt; "string"

  var word = new String("hello")
  typeof word =&gt; "object"
</code></pre>

<p><strong><a href ="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/talks/wat"> WAT.</a></strong> Literally that&#8217;s what I thought. Until I dug a little deeper.</p>

<p>Javascript has five primitive data types:<br>
1. Number<br>
2. String<br>
3. Boolean<br>
4. Undefined<br>
5. Null<br></p>

<p><strong>Anything that doesn&#8217;t belong to any of these five primitive types is considered an object.</strong></p>

<p><strong>BUT each of these five primitive data types has a corresponding object constructor.</strong> So to take my above example, you can create a string in two different ways.</p>

<p><strong>First as a primitive data type:</strong></p>

<pre><code>  var word = "hello";
</code></pre>

<p><strong>And then as an object:</strong></p>

<pre><code>  var word = new String("hello");
</code></pre>

<p><strong>The constructor function uses the <code>new</code> operator.</strong> A string object is very similar to a hash of characters.</p>

<pre><code>word;
=&gt; String {0: "h", 1: "e", 2: "l", 3: "l", 4: "o", formatUnicorn: function, truncate: function, splitOnLast: function, contains: function}
</code></pre>

<p>The word variable returns a has with each letter index.</p>

<p><strong>And each new object has methods associated with them based on what constructor was used.</strong> To continue with the string I created, there are plenty of methods available for string manipulation. (I&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s best practice to use primitive data types for strings if you don&#8217;t plan on using a lot of the methods.)</p>

<pre><code>word.length; =&gt; 5
word[0]; =&gt; "h"
word.split(""); =&gt; ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
word.toUpperCase(); =&gt; "HELLO"
</code></pre>

<p>One cool thing, Javascript gives you the ability to treat primitive data types as object. Let&#8217;s take a primitive string:</p>

<pre><code>  var greeting = "hello";
  greeting.size; =&gt; 5
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, behind the scenes, Javascript turns my primitive data type into an object, runs the <code>size</code> method, and then transforms it back to the primitive data type.</p>

<p>You can even check the different between the two:</p>

<pre><code>  var greeting = "hello";
  var word = new String("hello");
  word == greeting; =&gt; false
</code></pre>

<p>Conceptually, these are two totally different things. They&#8217;re not the same type, as per my original confusion one is a string and one is an object. Objects can have additional properties, so those two variables shouldn&#8217;t be equal because they&#8217;re not.</p>

<p><strong><em>So my last few weeks have been pretty Javascript heavy.</em></strong> I came across a situation where I needed to use the <code>onbeforeunload</code> method so that a popup would occur when a user tried to navigate away from an edit page. This method works on a global scope and is fired before the window is unloaded, or closed.  My popup was intended to remind a user to save their changes before leaving.</p>

<p><strong>The only issue with that is that the default functionality of this method</strong> ensures that a popup appears when a user tries to leave the page, even on a form submission. So clearly you need to be able to work around this. I don&#8217;t want a popup to appear reminding my user to save their changes when they clicked the save button.</p>

<p><strong>So the first step is to define the the function, and it&#8217;s return value.</strong></p>

<pre><code>        window.onbeforeunload = function(e) { 
            return "You have unsaved changes, please save them."
        };
</code></pre>

<p>The popup generated will look like this:<br>
<img src="/images/post_images/popup.png"></p>

<p>The only thing about this popup that can be customized is the message, which is defined in the return value of the function. The rest of it is a generic browswer popup. The same popup in Safari will look like this:<br></p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/safari-popup.png"></p>

<p><strong>Now, any link I click will cause this popup to appear.</strong> At this point, even submitting the form will induce this popup. Obviously not what I want.</p>

<p><strong>So the next thing I did was attach a click event to my submit button</strong> so that I could customize <code>onbeforeunload</code>&#8217;s typical functionality.</p>

<pre><code>    $('#save-button').live('click', function(){
        window.onbeforeunload = function(){};
    });
</code></pre>

<p>I am basically redefining onebeforeunload in the scope of that specific click event. Here, nothing will happen. But if I click any other link on my page, the popup will still appear. I only defined <code>onbeforeunload</code> to do nothing in the scope of that one specific click event.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>The last few weeks have been a whirl-wind of building, which has been so wonderful.</em></strong> I really feel like I got to flex my muscles a little bit (I learned to encrypt things..post to come later) but the other side of building is testing. I built three different mailers, and then learned that you can actually test your mailers with rspec. And it&#8217;s not that difficult!</p>

<p><strong>I chose a few very basic pieces of mailer functionality to test:</strong><br>
1. Was it actually sending the email<br>
2. Was the email being sent to the desired recipient<br>
3. Was the subject line of the email correct<br>
4. Was the email being sent from the correct address</p>

<p><strong>This was also really helpful because up until this week, we&#8217;ve only been able to test mailers locally.</strong> These Rspec tests were essentially the only way I was able to tell if the mailers were functioning how I wanted them to function.</p>

<p>So here was my mailer method:</p>

<pre><code>def confirmation_email(ordered_story)
  mail(to: story.email, subject: "Here Is Your Story!", content_type: "text/html")
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In my mailer spec, the first thing I did was set up a few configurations</strong> for ActionMailer that I declared to happened before each test.</p>

<pre><code>  before(:each) do
    ActionMailer::Base.delivery_method = :test
    ActionMailer::Base.perform_deliveries = true
    ActionMailer::Base.deliveries = []
    @story = Factory.create(:story)
    EbookConfirmationMailer.confirmation_email(@story).deliver
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m basically saying: send my emails in the testing environment (which does have to be explicitly declared), please actually perform all my deliveries, create an array of all my sent emails, build the factory for my story class (with an instance of that class), and then finally deliver my email.</p>

<p><strong>Then, I wanted to clear all of that after each test so I have a clean slate before each test.</strong></p>

<pre><code>after(:each) do
  ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.clear
end
</code></pre>

<p><strong>So now that I have all of that set up, the tests.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. Is the email being sent?</strong></p>

<pre><code>  it 'should send an email' do
    ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.count.should == 1
  end
</code></pre>

<p>I had originally set up my array of delivered emails, so in this test, there should only be one email. My before statement only called one email to be delivered.</p>

<p><strong>2. Is the email being sent to the desired recipient?</strong></p>

<pre><code>  it 'renders the receiver email' do
    ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.first.to.should == @story.email
  end
</code></pre>

<p>The Story class, has an email attribute, which is what is declared as the <code>to:</code> in my mailer method. The Story Factory builds an instance of the class with an email address which is the one that should be used to send the email (@story.email).</p>

<p><strong>3. Does the email have the correct subject line?</strong></p>

<pre><code>  it 'should set the subject to the correct subject' do
    ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.first.subject.should == 'Here Is Your Story!'
  end
</code></pre>

<p>The subject line of the email was expplicitly defined in my mailer. So if my email is sending properly, that subject line should be rendered in the email.</p>

<p><strong>4. Was the email being sent from the correct addres?</strong></p>

<pre><code>  it 'renders the sender email' do  
    ActionMailer::Base.deliveries.first.from.should == ['notifications@stories.com']
  end
</code></pre>

<p>When I defined my mailer, I defined a default from address <code>default :from =&gt; "notifications@stories.com"</code>
So just like the subject line, if the email is being sent properly, that should be the from address, plain and simple.</p>

<p>I guess the next step with these will be testing the mailer views (I also recently learned that you can write tests for views! Cool!)..so clearly I have lots more blog posts to write.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><strong><em>So I was recently asked to encrypt an id</em></strong>, and then somehow take that encryption and display it as part of a URL. Essentially, it was a mock form of security for a new feature at work, so that a user couldn&#8217;t just change an id in a url and move around things that should remain private.</p>

<p>_Encryption is an entirely new concept to me.__ I didn&#8217;t even know what it really meant. So it was a really big learning exercise for me. Ps. Encryption means to convert data into cipher. Oh and cipher is &#8220;diguised way of writing code&#8221; (thanks <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=cipher+definition&oq=cipher+definition&aqs=chrome.0.0l4.1710j0&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8"> Google </a>).</p>

<p><strong>1. Ruby has an OpenSSL library used for encryption.</strong>
This library has greate documention <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib-1.9.3/libdoc/openssl/rdoc/OpenSSL.html"> here </a></p>
