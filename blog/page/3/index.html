<p><strong><em>Recently during a pairing session, I learned about the ActiveRecord query, <code>pluck</code>.</em></strong> Essentially, it performs a single column select and returns an array of that data.</p>

<p>Say you have a Person class, and you want to select all the names for everyone in that class, all you would need to call is:</p>

<pre><code>  Person.pluck(:name)
  =&gt;["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]
</code></pre>

<p>Essentially, this is like calling,</p>

<pre><code>  SELECT name FROM person;
</code></pre>

<p>You can also use <code>pluck</code> to replace using <code>collect</code> and <code>map</code>.</p>

<pre><code>  Person.select(:name).map { |p| p.name }
  =&gt;["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]
</code></pre>

<p>Instead,</p>

<pre><code>  Person.pluck(:name)
  =&gt;["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]
</code></pre>

<p>Using <code>pluck</code> in this case is far more efficient than using map to return the same set of results. In the example with <code>map</code>, a full ActiveRecord Person record is returned and then the map is performed. <code>pluck</code> works directly at a database level, and only queries for exactly the information requested.</p>

<p>My last post was about <code>method_missing</code>. Since that post, I&#8217;ve gotten to play around with <code>method_missing</code> a lot, and think I&#8217;ve begun to grasp its power. It&#8217;s a crazy tool, and one that can be dangerous if not used wisely.</p>

<p>One thing I learned while rewriting the functionality of <code>method_missing</code> is that you must reopen and rewrite <code>respond_to</code> as well. <code>respond_to</code> is used to determine if an object responds to a method, i.e. allows the object to know a method is being called on it.</p>

<p>Becase <code>method_missing</code> allows you to call undefined methods, the object needs to know in some capicty what those are.
In the below example, I have written <code>method_missing</code> to be able to use <code>.get_*</code> and <code>.set_*</code> in order to access object in my database. The method name gets passed as a symbol to method missing, so it must be turned into a string before being used.</p>

<pre><code>def self.method_missing(method_name, *args, &amp;block)
  method_string = method_name.to_s
  if method_string.start_with?("get_")
    #do xyz
  elsif method_string.start)with?("set_")
    #do xyz
  else
    super
  end
end

def self.respond_to?(method_sym, include_private = false)
  if method_sym.to_s =~ /^get_(.*)$/ || method_sym.to_s =~ /^set_(.*)$/
    true
  else
    super
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>respond_to</code> now responds to my version of <code>method_missing</code>. I am essentially searching if the string version of my method includes <code>get_*</code> or <code>set_*</code> and if it does, it is a method that can be called on an object.</p>

<p>The <code>include_private = false</code> is necessary because by default, <code>respond_to</code> must be passed additional parameters to search for private methods. Methods are private for a reason, they don&#8217;t need to be accessed everywhere and by every object.</p>

<p>Also in both <code>method_missing</code> and <code>respond_to</code> my if/else clause ends by calling <code>super</code>. Essentially, if none of the above returns true, go back to your normal functionality and deliver me an error message.</p>

<p>Also note I am using class methods here. My practice with <code>method_missing</code> and <code>respond_to</code> was geared towards reading and writing objects to my database.</p>

<p>Last night I learned about Ruby&#8217;s <code>method_missing</code>.</p>

<p>As Ruby code is executed, it travels up the chain of inheritence to discover where your methods are defined. It will execute the first line of code that matches the method name in the method lookup path.</p>

<p>And of course, when there is an instance where you attempt to call an undefined method, the <code>NoMethodError</code> exception is raised. When this happens, Ruby searches up levels of inheritence until it reaches class BasicObject, which is the parent class of all classes in Ruby. Once it reaches BasicObject and still is unable to find a method, <code>NoMethodError</code> is returned.</p>

<p>This is where <code>method_missing</code> comes in to play. <code>method_missing</code> is a type of metaprogramming that allows programmers to call methods without explicitely defining them.</p>

<pre><code>class Test
  def method_missing(name, *args, &amp;block)
    puts "NAME: #{name}"
    puts "ARG: #{args}"
    puts "BLOCK: #{block}"
  end

end

t = Test.new

t.some_method("arbitrary argument")

#=&gt; NAME: some_method
    ARG: ["arbitrary argument"]
    BLOCK: 
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the only method defined in my class is <code>method_missing</code>. I passed in the method name, optional arguments, and an optional block. Once I instantiate a new instance of the Test class, I call a method <code>some_method</code> on it. But <code>some_method</code> hasn&#8217;t been defined. Normally this would return <code>NoMethodError</code> but because I used <code>method_missing</code>, <code>some_method</code> is accessible to me.</p>

<p>As you can see in my definition of <code>method_missing</code>, I asked it to print out the method name, any potential arguments, and any potential blocks. <code>some_method</code> has method name and an argument, but not a block. Everything I attempted to call on my instance of the Test class is executed thanks to <code>method_missing</code>.</p>

<p><strong><em>I just got back from a week vacation in Paris.</em></strong> The highlight of my trip was the day I spent with two different Ruby developers. Through some twitter introductions, I was able to schedule a morning at <a href="http://www.verseauparis.com/">Verseau Paris</a> with founder<a href="http://twitter.com/tracyloisel">Tracy Loisel</a> and an afternoon with <a href="http://twitter.com/tibastral">Thibaut Assus</a>, founder of <a href="http://meetup.rubyparis.org/">Paris.rb</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>It was so incredible to be welcome so whole-heartedly by developers abroad.</em></strong> Tracy was so willing to tell me his story, intrdouce me to his team, and show me around his office. And while there was a little bit of a language barrier (my french isn&#8217;t perfect), coding is international. We both have a story of why we started coding and Ruby provided a common language and basis of understanding. They even posted about me on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=521981374527257&set=a.309755622416501.69405.309620859096644&type=1&theater">facebook!</a></p>

<p>  <img src="/images/verseau.jpg"></p>

<p><strong><em>I had a very similiar experience in the afternoon with Thibaut.</em></strong> He welcomed me into his home, told me all about his projects, figured out we knew people in common, and we even laughed about how the PHP array method is bizarre. Commonality.</p>

<p><strong><em>My experience with these developers really hammered home how welcoming the Ruby community is.</em></strong> I am a very new developer, and these amazing developers in Paris were each willing to spend a few hours with me. I don&#8217;t know if you can find that in other industries. It was incredibly reaffirming for me. I am so excited to spend the rest of my life coding. Programming isn&#8217;t people talking to computers, it&#8217;s people talking to people, and bringing people together. It&#8217;s amazing.</p>

<p><strong><em>This morning, I learned what a linked list is.</em></strong> A linked list is a data structure that is comprised on a group of nodes. Essentially, each dataset is made up of it&#8217;s information, and a pointer. A pointer is a link to the next node in the data sequence. In the simplest of terms, if I am a dataset, I only know about myself, and the person that comes after me.</p>

<p><strong><em>Linked lists are most commonly compared to arrays.</em></strong> They both store data, and both have their pros and cons. In compiled languages, arrays are a fixed size. If you define an array to have 100 elements, it has 100 elements. While there are methods to resize an array in compiled languages, from what I&#8217;ve read, it&#8217;s not an easy task. Linked lists allow for a significantly easier process for inserting and deleting data, without shifting entire groups of elements up or down.</p>

<p><strong><em>So here is an example of a basic link list:</em></strong></p>

<p><img src="/images/linklist1.png"></p>

<p>This small data sequence is going to be listed in alphabetical order. All linked lists start with HEAD, which denotes the begining of the data sequence. The head contains a pointer, which points to the first object in the data set. In this case, HEAD points to &#8220;Boston&#8221;. The first dataset, contains the name of the city, and a pointer to the following dataset, here it is San Fransico. San Francisco points to the end, which is always signified by NULL. The last dataset will always point to NULL.</p>

<p>So in this case, Boston only knows that it exists, and knows about San Fransico. San Francisco only knows they exist, and that NULL exists. They don&#8217;t know anything about Boston.</p>

<p>So the process for inserting another city is fairly simple. Say we wanted to insert New York. Because of the alphabetical order, you will want to insert it between Boston and San Francisco. To do so, all you need to do is make New York point to San Francisco, and change Boston to point to New York. There is no shifting of indexes, or anything like that.</p>

<p><img src="/images/linklist2.png"></p>

<p>However the process of searching a linked list is difficult. While in an array, if you were trying to find San Francisco you should simply do <code>array[2]</code> to access San Francisco, it&#8217;s a much more expensive process in linked lists. In this final example, in order to search for San Francisco, you have to start at head, move through Boston and New York, to finally arrive at the data you are searching for.</p>

<p><strong><em>As my semester at <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">The Flatiron School</a> winds down,</em></strong> we&#8217;ve been spending our time building our final projects. My group, <a href="tmd.io">Tyler Davis</a>, <a href="dolin.github.com">Danny Olinsky</a>, and <a href="http://jlarusso.github.io/">Jesse La Russo</a>, is building a modern-take on an old fashioned gold star board. Aka, you write a blog post? You get a gold star. You finish a Code School course? You get a gold star. We&#8217;ve built in a lot of other functionality (our own authentication and authorization, the ability for users to give each other stars, background cron jobs, etc. etc.), but that&#8217;s the gist of it.</p>

<p><strong><em>The best thing about this whole process</em></strong> has been the things I&#8217;ve learned from the errors we get. In this way, I learned about the <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-1.9.3/Marshal.html">Ruby Marshal Module</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The Marshal Module</em></strong> essentially takes a collection of Ruby Objects and converts them into a byte stream, and then allows it to be stored and accessed elsewhere.</p>

<p><strong><em>One of this big things with our project has been working with APIs</em></strong> in order to automate the processes of giving stars. The Treehouse API was particularly difficult to parse through, so for the time being, I created a dictionary to deal with their objects. Essentially, we want to give a star for every category a user completes.</p>

<pre><code>  @@dictionary = {
  "Website Basics" =&gt; ["Website Basics"],
  "Technology Foundations" =&gt; ['Graphic Basics'],
  "Aesthetic Foundations" =&gt; ["Elements", "Principles", "Color Theory"],
  "HTML" =&gt; ["Introduction", "Text", "Lists", "Links", "Objects", "Tables", "Forms"],
  "CSS Foundations" =&gt; ["Introduction", "Selectors", "Data Types", "Text", "Box Model", "Page Layout", "Printing", "Framework Foundations"],
  "CSS3" =&gt; ["Selectors", "Typography", "Web Fonts", "Borders", "Gradients", "Backgrounds", "Transitions", "Transforms", "Animation", "Multi-Column Layouts", "Media Queries"],
  "Build a Responsive Website" =&gt; ["Introduction to Response Web Design", "Fluid Foundation", "Adaptive Design", "Responsive Design", "Advanced Techniques"],
  "Introduction to Programming" =&gt; ["Basics", "Control Structures", "Objects and Arrays", "Functions"],
  "JavaScript Foundations" =&gt; ["Introduction Variables", "JavaScript Strings", "JavaScript Numbers", "JavaScript Arrays", "JavaScript Functions", "JavaScript Objects"],
  "Ruby Foundations" =&gt; ["Ruby Basics", "Objects, Classes, and Variables", "Ruby Strings", "Ruby Numbers", "Ruby Arrays", "Ruby Hashes", "Ruby Methods", "Ruby Loops", "Ruby Blocks", "Ruby Procs &amp; Lambdas", "Ruby Modules", "Ruby Core", "Standard Library", "Ruby Testing"],
  "Build a Simple Ruby on Rails Application" =&gt; ["Getting Started with Rails", "Rails Frontend Development", "Ruby on Rails Authentication", "Customizing Ruby on Rails Forms", "Writing Tests", "Rails Routing", "Testing the Whole App", "Building the Profile Page", "Rails Deployment"]
}
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>In this dictionary,</em></strong> the star (which is also the Treehouse badge category) is the key. The values (represented as an array of strings) are all the badges you can earn. Essentially, the values are the requirements a user must fulfill to receive a Treehouse Star. In order to do that, we had to create methods that would parse through the Treehouse API, take a collection of all a user&#8217;s badges, and iterate those badges through our dictionary.</p>

<pre><code>  def check_star_requirement(th_json)
    #check json of badge names on profile
    badges = th_json["badges"].collect { |badge| badge["name"] }
    completed_stars_array = @@dictionary.each do |star, requirement|
      star if check_requirements(badges, requirement) 
    end
    completed_stars_array.compact
  end

  def check_requirements(badges, requirement)
    (badges &amp; requirement) == requirement
  end 
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>check_star_requirement</code> methodtakes the Treehose json for a user (in my case, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/victoriafriedman.json">teamtreehouse.victoriafriedman.json</a>), iterates through their information on the Treehouse API and collects all their badges. Those badges are saved in an array called <code>badges</code>. Then the dictionary is saved as an array, <code>completed_stars_array</code> and iterated through.</p>

<p>It then calls the <code>check_requirements</code> method, which iterates through the values of the dictionary. If the strings in <code>badges</code> matches any of values in <code>dictionary</code>, then a user will receive that star.</p>

<p>All of this seemed to be working great until we checked our database. Rails &#8220;marshaled&#8221; our data. An individual entry in our Star table in the Name column, looked like this:</p>

<pre><code>  Aesthetic Foundations
    - Elements
    - Principles
    - Color Theory
</code></pre>

<p>Avi pointed us towards the Ruby Marshaling Module. Essentially, Ruby was taking our entire collection, our dictionary, and transforming each key-value pair into a string (which apparently looked like the above example). We were essentially calling, <code>Marshal::Dump</code>, which saves the data and returns the original string. Because the <code>each</code> method also just returns the original string, our iteration wasn&#8217;t just saving the key, <code>Aesthetic Foundations</code>, to our database, but the entire string.</p>

<p>Our solution to this problem was really simple, essentially we replaced <code>each</code> with <code>collect</code>. Collect returns the new array, so in our case, it returns an array of key values in the dictionary, but only the key where values are all contained in the badges array.</p>

<p><strong><em>Last week, I presented an app to <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/">NYC on Rails</a>.</em></strong> The main focus was to learn about ActionMailer, paired with cron jobs and the <a href="https://github.com/javan/whenever">Whenever gem</a>.</p>

<p><strong><em>The hardest part of all of it was configuring the cron log</em></strong> to write to the correct files. I was getting permission errors when trying to get cron to write to the log directly in my application. In the end, I managed to configure the crontab to print errors to a directy of my computer.</p>

<pre><code>set :cron_log, "~/log/cron_log.log"
</code></pre>

<p><strong><em>While this gave cron proper permissions</em></strong> and allowed me to debug during development, I ended up 283 system emails on my computer, sent directly to victoria@victoria-miranda-friedman&#8217;s-macbook. And I had no idea how to remove them from my root directory.</p>

<p>Every time I entered terminal, I saw this message:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/youve_got_mail.png"></p>

<p>In order to enter your mailbox, type <code>mail</code>. This will display:</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/mail_display.png"></p>

<p>The return in terminal clearly tells you <code>Type ? for help.</code>, which returns a list of all possible methods to act on your mailbox and its contents</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/mail_options.png"></p>

<p>And from here, you get clear instructions on how to delete your mail. To delete one email, enter <code>d 1</code>. If you wanted to delete ten emails, you would enter <code>d 1-10</code>, or in my first attempt <code>d 1-283</code>.</p>

<p><img src="/images/post_images/delete.png"></p>

<p>The next thing I learned about cron mail, was that <code>exit</code>, exits you from your inbox, but doesn&#8217;t save any changes. <code>quit</code> is the command that saves and exits. And as you can see in the image above, after I <code>quit</code> and then entered my mailbox again, I&#8217;m told <code>no mail for victoria</code></p>

<p>This week, I started working on a presentation with two other girls, <a href="http://1aurabrown.github.com/">Laura Brown</a> and <a href="http://anabecker.tumblr.com/">Ana Becker</a> to present at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/nyc-on-rails/">NYC on Rails</a> meetup this coming Thursday (March 28). Our app revolves around using <a href ="http://rubygems.org/gems/actionmailer"> ActionMailer</a>. And this was the first time I&#8217;ve tried to use the gem.</p>

<p>The documentation for it is really good, and the implementation doesn&#8217;t require too many steps. <a href="http://guides.rubyonrails.org/action_mailer_basics.html">RailsGuides</a> has a great step by step breakdown of the entire process, inluding the steps for generating a Mailer.</p>

<p>All of that was easy. I only wanted to render a default template in my view, and am staying away from user authentication.</p>

<p>My problem fell in the configurations. I had no idea that I had to setup SMTP configurations to send my email. And then once I figured that out, where do I enter my specific configurations.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> <br>
At first we weren&#8217;t getting any errors. It seemed as if our app was sending emails&#8230;but no one was getting any of them. The first thing we had to do was edit <code>config/evironments/development.rb</code>. That file contains the line:</p>

<pre><code>  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = false
</code></pre>

<p>which needs to be changed to read:</p>

<pre><code>  config.action_mailer.raise_delivery_errors = true
</code></pre>

<p>And then we started to get errors we could work from.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> <br>
Because we&#8217;re using a Gmail account for our gem, we had to configure ActionMailer specifically for that account. The first step to that was to include the following two lines:</p>

<pre><code>config.action_mailer.perform_deliveries = true
config.action_mailer.delivery_method = :smtp
</code></pre>

<p>These lines delcares that SMTP will deliver our emails. SMTP stands for Simple Mail Transfer Protocol. This protocol also has a layer of authentication built into it&#8217;s functionality</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong><br>
The next step is to declare your specific SMTP configurations.</p>

<pre><code> config.action_mailer.smtp_settings = {
  :address =&gt; 'smtp.gmail.com',
  :port =&gt; 587,
  :domain =&gt; 'localhost:3000',
  :authentication =&gt; :plain,
  :user_name =&gt; '&lt;email_address&gt;',
  :password =&gt; '&lt;email_password&gt;',
  :authentication =&gt; 'plain',
  :enable_starttls_auto =&gt; true
}
</code></pre>

<p>These configurations state that we&#8217;re using Gmail, we&#8217;re running our app on localhost:3000, and also includes the email address and password for that account that are associated with the app. The last two lines of the settings handle the authentication of the email account.</p>

<p>And that&#8217;s it!</p>

<p>One of the big differences between Ruby and other object oriented languages is that a class in Ruby can inherit from one and only one class. Essentially, each class can only have one parent, but many children.</p>

<p>A great example to understand basic inheritence is to think about it in terms of animals. A cat is a mammal. And all mammals are animals. To break this down in Ruby, that inheritence would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>class Animal
end

class Mammal &lt; Animal
end

class Cat &lt; Mammal
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>&lt;</code> denotes inheritence. In this example, the class Cat inherits all the properties from the Mammal class, as well as the Animal class.</p>

<pre><code>class Animal

  def breathe
    "inhale"
  end
end

class Mammal &lt; Animal

  def hair
    "Mammals are the only category of animals that have true hair"
  end
end

class Cat &lt; Mammal

  def meow
    "MEOW"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, all instances of the Cat class say &#8220;MEOW&#8221;, have true hair, and breathe. However, they only inherit directly from Mammal, and Mammal only directly inherits from Animal. No instances of Mammal say &#8220;MEOW&#8221;.</p>

<p>Another great way to extend functionality to a class in Ruby is through the use of Modules.</p>

<p>A Module is a collection of methods and constants.  A module is made up of resuable code that doesn&#8217;t naturally form a class. Because it is not a class, a module can&#8217;t have instance methods.</p>

<p>Modules allow you to implement mixins. A mixin is a way to either include or extend the functionality of your Module to mulitple Ruby classes.</p>

<p>When you Include a module in a class you are including the module methods as instance methods of that class. When you Extend a module in a class, you are adding the module methods as class methods. Essentially, when you declare <code>extend</code> in your classes, you are saying <code>self.extend</code>.</p>

<p>I found a great example of this functionality in action via <a href="http://rubysource.com/ruby-mixins-2/">Ruby Source</a>.</p>

<pre><code>module Logging
  def logger
    @logger ||= Logger.new(opts)
  end
end

class Person
  include Logging
    def relocate
      logger.debug "Relocating person..."
        # do relocation stuff
    end
end
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the Logging module provides an instance of a logger (<code>@logger</code>). Because class Person includes the Logging module, all of it&#8217;s methods are mixed-in as instances methods. The method logger is now a method that acts on all instances of the Person class.</p>

<p>Another option is to extend the Logger module:</p>

<pre><code>  module Logging

    def logger
      @@logger ||= Logger.new(opts)
    end

  end

  class Person
    extend Logging

      def relocate
        Person.logger.debug "Relocating person..."

        # could also access it with this

        self.class.logger.debug "Relocating person..."

      end
    end
</code></pre>

<p>In this example, the Logger module as a class variable <code>@@logger</code> which allows this module to be extended to multiple classes. Because the module is extended to the class Person, the method defined in the module can only be called on the class itself, here it is demonstrated in two ways:</p>

<pre><code>Person.logger.debug
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>self.logger.debug
</code></pre>

<p><strong>In my last <a href="http://vicfriedman.github.com/blog/2013/03/03/webserver-101/">post</a>, I explained how to create a webserver<strong> using <a href="www.dediserve.com">Dediserve.com</a>. [NB: Dediserve.com is the cloud provider]. This post will cover the second half of the webserver setup, including installing gems, deploying with Capistrano, generating SSH keys on github, installing Passenger, and installing and configuring nginx.</p>

<p>Now that you have a server that you can connect to, it&#8217;s time to set it up to run your application on it.</p>

<h3>Prepping to Deploy </h3>


<p>The first step in this process is install the <code>build-essential</code> package (which installs all the developer tools that your Ubuntu Server does not automatically come with, including <code>gcc</code> and <code>make</code>), as well as a Ruby 1.9, Rubygems and their development packages, and PostgresSQL (our database server).</p>

<p>In order to install all of these, you must run <code>apt-get</code>, which is Ubuntu&#8217;s management system. This system also speeds up the download process. Instead of spending days running around to all the necessary FTP servers, and then fetch and compile their packages, <code>apt-get</code> takes mere minutes. To get the correct version of this management system, run this command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get update
</code></pre>

<p>Once the update has completed, you&#8217;ll want to install the system.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get upgrade
</code></pre>

<p>Press <code>enter</code> when you are prompted to confirm.</p>

<p>The next step is to install the <code>build-essential</code> package.</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install build-essential
</code></pre>

<p>Followed by the Ruby packages</p>

<pre><code>sudo apt-get install ruby1.9.3 sqlite3 libsqlite3-ruby libsqlite3-dev
</code></pre>

<p>This installs Ruby 1.9.3, SQLite3 and all of the libraries associated with SQLite3. Ruby and SQLite3 are necessary in order to get a functioning basic Rails application.</p>

<p>Once all of these are installed, you&#8217;ll need to install all of the dependant gems. I used Bundle for my gem management.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install bundler
</code></pre>

<p>Then the <code>SQLite3</code> gem.</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install sqlite3 sinatra
</code></pre>

<p>When creating this server, I was using a Sinatra application. If you are trying to use this process to set up your server for a Rails app, you would run <code>sudo gem install sqlite3 rails</code>.</p>

<p>I also used <a href="https://www.phusionpassenger.com/">Passenger</a>, which is a rack app server for Ruby and Python using Nginx. It essentially handles all the heavy lifting for managing your apps processes and resources. This means it makes deploying your app as seamless as possible. Nginx is an open-source web server for HTTP, SMTP, POP3 and IMAP protocols, and is quickly approaching Apache as the most popular. Because Nginx takes an event driven approach, they can handle higher loads of requests.</p>

<p>To install Passenger:</p>

<pre><code>sudo gem install passenger
</code></pre>

<h3> Capistrano  </h3>


<p>Capistrano is an open source tool which executes commands on multiple remote servers, concurrently, and is primarily used for deploying applications.</p>

<pre><code>gem install capistrano
</code></pre>

<p>There are two commands available with Capistrano.<br>
<code>capify</code>: used to prepare your application to be deployed using Capistrano<br>
<code>cap</code>: used to actually deploy your application</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure you&#8217;re in your repository&#8217;s directory before you run any Capistrano commands. From there, enter</p>

<pre><code>capify
</code></pre>

<p>This command creates a <code>capfile</code> and creates a directory called <code>config</code>. This directory contains a file called <code>deploy.rb</code>. The <code>capfile</code> is where the <code>cap</code> command accesses it&#8217;s configurations.</p>

<p>Next, you&#8217;ll need to edit the <code>config/deploy.rb</code> file. These edits will enable us deploy our application.</p>

<pre><code>require 'bundler/capistrano' # for bundler support

set :application, "studentbody"
set :repository,  "GITHUB_REPOSITORY"

set :user, 'USERNAME'
set :deploy_to, "/home/#{ user }/#{ application }"
set :use_sudo, false

set :scm, :git

default_run_options[:pty] = true

role :web, "96.8.123.64"                          # Your HTTP server, Apache/etc
role :app, "96.8.123.64"                          # This may be the same as your `Web` server

# if you want to clean up old releases on each deploy uncomment this:
# after "deploy:restart", "deploy:cleanup"

# if you're still using the script/reaper helper you will need
# these http://github.com/rails/irs_process_scripts

# If you are using Passenger mod_rails uncomment this:
namespace :deploy do
 task :start do ; end
 task :stop do ; end
 task :restart, :roles =&gt; :app, :except =&gt; { :no_release =&gt; true } do
   run "#{try_sudo} touch #{File.join(current_path,'tmp','restart.txt')}"
 end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This file is all written in Ruby, just with Capistrano syntax. In this file, we set these variables: <br>
<code>application</code>: the name of our application.<br>
<code>repository</code>: the URL for the repository on Github. This needs to be replaced with yours. <br>
<code>deploy_to</code>: The location on the remote server where we will deploy the application.<br>
<code>use_sudo</code>: set to false because deploying to a location we own.<br>
<code>user</code>: the user that we created to log into our server.<br>
<code>scm</code>: the source-code-management system we&#8217;re using (in my case, Git).<br>
<code>default_run_options[:pty] = true.</code>: need to ensure that Capistrano interacts with our terminal correctly.<br>
<code>role</code>: We define two roles, both the web and app roles- to manage both the database and the application.<br>
Uncomment <code>:deploy</code> because Capistrano is task-oriented. Here we uncommented starting, stopping, and resetting our application via the Passenger interface.<br>
<code>require 'bundler/capistrano</code>: To ensure Bundler support.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to make sure that both the <code>capfile</code> and  <code>config/deploy.rb</code> are committed and pushed to your github repository.</p>

<h3> Generating an SSH Key </h3>


<p>If you are deploying your application from a private Github repository, you will need to generate a SSH key to act as your &#8220;deploy key&#8221;. This gives your server authentication to access your repository, without you manually entering your github name and password.</p>

<pre><code>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096
</code></pre>

<p>This create a key with the type of &#8220;RSA&#8221; (a global standard for encryption) and makes the key size 4096 bits (a veryyyy strong key).</p>

<p>You will be prompted for the location of the file and for a password. DO NOT set a password for this key. A password completely defeats the purpose of the key in the first place.</p>

<p>This key generates two files:
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa</code>: your private RSA key
<code>~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub</code>: your public RSA key. This key is ok to distribute.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll want to enter your private key into your github settings.</p>

<p><img src="/images/github_setting.png"></p>

<p>Once there, select the SSH Key option from the menu on the left of the page.</p>

<p><img src="/images/ssh.png"></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll then want to select &#8220;Add SSH Key&#8221; and copy and paste your private SSH Key there. You don&#8217;t need to title it. Github will automatically generate a title to match your server. Make sure you save!</p>

<p><img src="/images/new_key.png"></p>

<p>You&#8217;ll then want to add the contents of your public key to your server</p>

<pre><code>cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
</code></pre>

<h3> Preparing to Deploy AND Actually Deploying!</h3>


<p>Because Capistrano has a full deployment framework built in, the first step is to ensure that it&#8217;s file structure is in place to deploy your app. In your terminal from the repository&#8217;s directory, run</p>

<pre><code>cap deploy:setup
</code></pre>

<p>This command will connect to your server, prompt you for your password, and create the necessary directory structure on your server.</p>

<p>It creates a very simple file structure:</p>

<pre><code>/home/USERNAME/repository/
releases/
shared/
</code></pre>

<p>When your application is deployed, your github repository is copied into your <code>releases/</code> directory. A symbolic link is created from that directory to the directory of your application, and names it <code>current</code>. This allows you to release updates of your code while still tracking older versions.</p>

<p>Once your github repository is up to date, you can deploy in one simple command</p>

<pre><code>cap deploy
</code></pre>

<h3> Nginx In&#8217;s and Out&#8217;s </h3>


<p>Nginx is the actual webserver. It speaks HTTP and sits between the client (typically a browser) and your application. Passenger interacts with Nginx by starting up several &#8220;handlers&#8221; for your application. This means that several instances of your application will be running all at once. This allows your server to handle multiple requests to your server per second. This also ensures that each instance of your application is only handling once request at a time. Nginx speeds up and smooths out this process.</p>

<p>Passenger has partly configured Nginx for us, but to finish it off, you&#8217;ll want to edit <code>/opt/nginx/conf.</code> using vim. Vim is a text editor that you can load in your terminal.</p>

<pre><code>sudo vim /opt/nginx/conf/nginx.conf
</code></pre>

<p>Once this file is open, you&#8217;ll want to make the following changes:</p>

<p><code>#user  nobody;</code> You will need to uncomment out this line and change it to read <code>user www-data;</code>.</p>

<p>Then you&#8217;ll want to find the block that reads:</p>

<pre><code>location / {
  root   html;
  index  index.html index.htm;
}
</code></pre>

<p>And edit it to read:</p>

<pre><code>root /home/USERNAME/APPNAME/current/public;
passenger_enabled on;
</code></pre>

<p>Nginx can be stopped and started by running</p>

<pre><code>/opt/nginx/sbin/nginx
</code></pre>

<p>But because this command is long, you can create a shorten it to <code>nginx</code> by creating a symlink (symbolic link).</p>

<p>Terminal controlls Unix systems by navigating through paths. A path is a series of directories that denote a specific location. To inspect your current path, run</p>

<pre><code>printenv PATH
</code></pre>

<p>You should get a response that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games
</code></pre>

<p>We will want to place the symlink to nginx in <code>/usr/local/sbin</code> becuase, by default, <code>/usr/local</code> is the location that administrators should put any programs that aren&#8217;t automatically installed by your package managers. To do so,</p>

<pre><code>sudo ln -s /opt/nginx/sbin/nginx /usr/local/sbin/
</code></pre>

<p>Now, <code>nginx -h</code> will display all the series of arguments associated with the <code>nginx</code> command.</p>

<p>To start Nginx, enter</p>

<pre><code>sudo nginx
</code></pre>

<p>This should automatically return your prompt. Nginx spawns a connection in the background so that you can continue to work directly on your server. Once it&#8217;s running, you should be able to access your application by going to</p>

<pre><code>http://YOUR-IP
</code></pre>

<p>To stop Nginx, enter</p>

<pre><code>sudo nginx -s stop
</code></pre>

<p>And that&#8217;s it! Your application has been deployed to your very own server!
Congratulations!!</p>
