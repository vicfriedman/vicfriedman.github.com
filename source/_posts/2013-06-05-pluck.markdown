***Recently during a pairing session, I learned about the ActiveRecord query, `pluck`.*** Essentially, it performs a single column select and returns an array of that data.

Say you have a Person class, and you want to select all the names for everyone in that class, all you would need to call is:
      Person.pluck(:name)
      =>["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]


Essentially, this is like calling,
      SELECT name FROM person;



You can also use `pluck` to replace using `collect` and `map`.

      Person.select(:name).map { |p| p.name }
      =>["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]

Instead,

      Person.pluck(:name)
      =>["Victoria", "Nat", "Peach"]

Using `pluck` in this case is far more efficient than using map to return the same set of results. In the example with `map`, a full ActiveRecord Person record is returned and then the map is performed. `pluck` works directly at a database level, and only queries for exactly the information requested.
